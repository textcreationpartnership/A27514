            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hath been no Chriſtian Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeas, departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath given ſo much honourable reſpect unto the Lords day (our Chriſtian Sabbath) as
<pb facs="tcp:102301:3"/> wee here in this our flouriſhing Kingdome and Nation: And it was our glory ſo to honour the Lord Chriſt; and it will be our great unhappineſſe to faile in this our Chriſtian duty, ſo confirmed by Scripture, and the generall practice of all true worſhippers of his glorious name throughout the whole Chriſtian world, the ſpace of theſe ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>Yet in this our time, and of late dayes, are ſtepped up among us certaine vaine men, prophane enough, who have attempted to deprive Chriſt Jeſus of his glory (in the religious obſervation of this day, grounded upon his glorious Reſurrection) and us of our ſpirituall conſolation, in keeping an whole day ſet apart for his worſhip and ſervice.</p>
            <p>For this end, books upon books have beene written, and by licence paſſed the Preſſe, to take away the morallity of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, never, in any age heretofore, doubted of; to make alſo people beleeve, that our Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath hath no warrant from thence, and that it is not of divine inſtitution, but alterable from that firſt day of the week, equallizing their deviſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-dayes with it, and allowing alſo the like vaine ſports upon this day, as upon the other dayes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch as religiouſly ſet the whole day apart for holy uſes, <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and <hi>Iudaizers,</hi> thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and in their ſenſe, belying thoſe that more truly honour Chriſt than they doe.</p>
            <p>And that they might ſecurely go on in theſe
<pb facs="tcp:102301:3"/> their prophane errours without controule, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the more inconſiderate ſort, that what they have written, are truths, and unanſwerable; they have ſtopped the meanes of printing ſound Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes to their empoyſoned propoſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they have beene bold to inſult over godly orthodox Divines, with too many words of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſcorne, and much contempt; which they have borne with great patience, waiting the Lords leiſure till he ſhould bee pleaſed in his good time to give liberty for the publiſhing of their learned labours, which have of long time lien by them.</p>
            <p>And now (bleſſed be God) the time is come, the way is made open by your honourable wiſdomes, goodneſſe, power, and authority, for godly and learned men to diſcover the vaine boaſtings, and the folly of thoſe evill ones, to the view of all. Some of ours proceed polemically, and have made anſwer fully to the beſt eſteemed of thoſe prophane writers. Some only write poſitively, to diſcover the truth, and to make it knowne in a plaine way, that the meaneſt capacity may bee rightly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: This way have I taken in this threefold Treatiſe, humbly craving pardon for my bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in preſenting to your honourable view theſe my weak endeavours.</p>
            <p>But the cauſe is Chriſts, and ſo deſerves accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and promotion: God hath appointed you at this time, as his worthieſt and meeteſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for this end: I cannot therefore ſeek for other Patrons in exalting the honour of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:102301:4"/> which by theſe men hath been ſo diſhonoured, and his people ſo abuſed. For the redreſſe whereof, as you have nobly begun, ſo to proceed on to do ever valiantly in the beſt ſervice of your God, there ſhall not be wanting the hearty and earneſt prayers of</p>

                     <p>I call it the Patriarchall Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was known and obſerved of the holy Fathers, of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, till <hi>Moſes</hi> and Iſrael received the Law. And to diſtinguiſh it from the Moſaicall and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbaths, of which in the two Treatiſes following.</p>
                     <p>Some there be, and more of late, than heretofore, that do deny the Sabbath to be here inſtituted.</p>

                     <p> Becauſe, ſay ſome of them, (for they be not all of one minde) that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the words by a figure called <hi>Anticipation</hi> or <hi>Prolepſis:</hi> Other ſome, that they be words of deſtination, that in time to come the ſeventh day ſhould be bleſſed and ſanctified to Iſrael for the Sabbath day; and ſo the words not to be taken for a preſent Inſtitution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day then.</p>
                     <p>So the Queſtion is, whether the Sabbath day in this place of Geneſis hath its firſt ground and eſtabliſhment, and here its firſt inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Many of the Ancients, ſome of the learnedſt Jewiſh Rabbies, very many judicious Divines among us Proteſtants, and divers learned Papiſts, do hold the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>Some (few in compariſon of the other) do hold the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, upon the former ſuppoſitions; ſuppoſitions I call them, for that they have no ground of Reaſon from either the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Circumſtance of the Text.</p>

                     <p>Here its fit in the firſt place to ſhew what is an Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
                     <p>It's the ſetting down of a thing in order of ſtory before, which cometh to be ſo in order of time afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of every ſuch Anticipation is from the Penman of the Hiſtorie, who writeth down things not as they were of old at the firſt, but as they then were, when he wrote the ſtory.</p>
                     <p>Such an Anticipation here, ſome of them only ſo ſay, or do reſt on others who affirme it, without allegation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this their conception, and brain birth.</p>

                     <p> But there is one of late who hath produced his grounds for it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe, ſaith he, the words may be thus tranſlated:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And God hath bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hath ſanctified it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hath,</hi> is but an Engliſh particle, and not of force in the Hebrew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Greek, or Latine, which yet if we adde to the other verbs, as, <hi>He hath ended,</hi> and <hi>hath rested,</hi> ſpeaking of that ſame time, would be abſurd.</p>

                        <p>In every Anticipation, the name, act, or thing foreſpoken of in order of Storie, hath its dependance, and riſe from ſome thing following, yet before in order of time. For this is an Anticipation, as is before ſhewed: and it is moſt true, in every ſuch figure: See it in inſtances.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Bethel</hi> is a prolepſis: <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 8. from <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Gilead</hi> is a prolepſis: <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 31. from <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 47.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Gilgal</hi> is a prolepſis: <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 4. 19. from <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Bochim</hi> is a prolepſis: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 1. from <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Exo:</hi> 16. 33, 34. which act was when the Tabernacle was built, and the Teſtimony made afterwards: <hi>Exo.</hi> 25. and 26. and 27. on which the truth of this act of <hi>Aaron</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth.</p>
                        <p>In 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 54. is a prolepſis, for the act of <hi>David</hi> here mentioned could not be true, till afterward he won the ſtrong hold of <hi>Zion,</hi> and got <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                        <p>In all theſe, and in every other prolepſis, there is ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance ſo clear and evident, as none can doubt of the truth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102301:7"/> of the figure, except we would faultie the narration with an untruth.</p>
                        <p>But now theſe words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. have not their truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon any thing after recorded in Scripture, which was before this act of God in time.</p>
                        <p>For who can ſay truely, and ſollidly prove it, that the words in <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 11. were the inſtitution of the Sabbath in time before this in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For tis manifeſt that the Sabbath was kept before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law. <hi>Exo.</hi> 16. 30.</p>
                        <p>And again the words in <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 11. ſhew us, not what new thing God did then, but what he had done, when he reſted the ſeventh day, from his ſix dayes works in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                        <p>For as God telleth them what he had done in the very firſt ſix dayes in the beginning, ſo he told them what he did that very ſeventh on which he reſted from his work; he bleſſed, and hallowed it, and made it the Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>Therefore its to be concluded, from the nature of a true Prolepſis, and the dependance of that which is firſt ſpoken, upon that which maketh it ſo in time, that here is no Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is cleare that there is no Anticipation in the words, which ſome perhaps well weighing, have deviſed another ſhift to darken the plaine narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that here ſhould not be conceived a preſent inſtitution of the firſt Sabbath: and this is by interpreting the words by way of Deſtination, which ſtiffely ſome maintaine contrary to the opinion and judgement of many learned men, aſwell Papiſt as Proteſtant Divines as afterwards ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>For better proceeding herein, to ſhew the error, and to cleare the truth: let us ſee, firſt what they meane by Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to wit, Gods purpoſe and intention to have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <note place="margin">1 What is meant by Deſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> day mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. to be the Sabbath day in actuall uſe, after the giving of the Law upon Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, 2450 yeares after Gods creation of the world, and his reſting on the firſt ſeventh day: this is their conceited Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the day.</p>
                     <p>Next, before I come to their Reaſons, let us ſee what they yeeld us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that God beſtowed a ſpeciall prerogative, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment <note place="margin">2 Our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> upon the ſeventh day, ſetting it apart from the reſt of the week: That this was done (ſaith a learned Oppoſite) we all agree, but when it was done is the queſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102301:9"/>
                     <p> Secondly, it is ſaid further, that when God had ended his workes, he ordained and appointed that the ſeventh day, the day of his owne reſt, ſhould bee that on which his Church ſhould reſt, and follow his example; and this was that great bleſſing and prerogative beſtowed on that day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is moreover granted, that the ſeventh day was from the beginning the day of Gods reſt, and might have been imployed as the Lords Sabbath; and ſome dayes doubtleſſe were thus beſtowed, and perhaps this.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, that the cauſe and reaſon of the Sabbaths ſanctification, (to wit, Gods reſt) was from the beginning, though the ſanctification it ſelfe was a long time after</p>
                     <p>From all this note: Firſt, that the ſeventh day was the day of Gods own reſt; Secondly, that this his reſt was the cauſe or reaſon of the Sabbaths ſanctification; Thirdly, that as God actually reſted, ſo he then actually ſanctified the day, deputed and conſecrated it unto reſt; Fourthly, that this his reſt was exemplarie, he ordayning and appointing that the Church ſhould follow his example; Fiftly, that he ſet it apart from the reſt of the weeke; Sixthly, and ſo beſtowed upon it a ſpeciall prerogative and perferment, and a great bleſſing, which was his appointing it the day of the Churches reſting and following his example; Seventhly, that that day might have beene imployed as the Lords Sabbath, that ſome dayes doubtleſſe were thus imployed, and perhaps, the ſeventh day it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre wee accord, and if well weighed, it might eaſily overthrow their diſcord from us, and bring them home to us: for our diſagreement is only in this:</p>
                     <p>Wee ſay, that all this which they yeeld, was for the time preſent, by way of actuall uſe and employment: <note place="margin">3. Our diſcord.</note> They ſay it was only by Deſtination, and Gods purpoſe to have it ſo, after he ſhould give his Law on Mount-Sinai, after the deſtruction of the old world, in a new
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102301:10"/> world, (as it were) after the Iſraelites delivery out of Aegypt 2400 yeeres from the worlds creation: How likely this is, let the indifferent Reader judge. But let us ſee their reaſons.</p>

What reaſon is there to leave the proper and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation, and take a figurative, and ſo rare a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word? Againe, a word of many ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, muſt have the ſignification given it, as may be approved by the circumſtance of the Text, and not (as wee pleaſe) to apply it for our own purpoſe, without proofe. Thirdly, who knoweth not that to <hi>prepare,</hi> is for preſent uſe very often, ſee in <hi>Exo.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 1. 11 and <hi>Ester</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 8. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 12. 15. therefore it is unſound, from a bare ſignification to conclude a future Deſtination for a very long time after.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 For <hi>Muſculus</hi> expreſſing of it <hi>Deſtinatus:</hi> I anſwer firſt, that none tranſlateth the Text it ſelfe ſo. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Arias Montanus, Pagnine, the Septuagint, the Chaelde paraphraſe, the vulgar Edition;</hi> all of them tranſlate it by <note place="margin">See <hi>Avernarius Schindlerus</hi> and the reſt.</note> 
                           <hi>Sanctificavit,</hi> and none by <hi>Deſtinavit.</hi> Secondly, no where do the Dictionaries expreſſe the Hebrew Word in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. by <hi>Deſtinavit,</hi> but by <hi>Significavit:</hi> Why therefore ſhould a ſingular expreſſion by any on ſingle man occaſion any to wreſt a Text of Scripture, from its common and plaine ſenſe, to uphold a new device? Thirdly, though <hi>Muſculus</hi> doth thus expreſſe the Word, doth hee thereforecoyne ſuch an interpretation? He doth not. And therefore his Deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no more, but the ſetting apart of the day to bee a Sabbath, to ordaine and chuſe it for that end. Fourthly, that none may be deceived by the Word <hi>Deſtination,</hi> wee muſt underſtand that there is a double Deſtination.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 A <hi>future Deſtination</hi> for time and imployment, the time longer on ſhorter, as there is uſe of the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to future time, becauſe the thing deſtinated in Gods decree, hath not exiſtence or being before ſuch a time. This was the Deſtination of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Eſai</hi> 44. 28. and 45. 1. long before he was borne, and when he was made King, in the firſt yeere of his raigne, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that which God had deſtinated him unto, <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 1. 1.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102301:11"/> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 22. To this kind of Deſtination muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Ieremie</hi> to bee a Prophet before he was borne: So <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> Chriſts fore-runner, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> a choſen veſſell to beare Chriſts name before the Gentiles and Kings, and <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15.</note> the Children of Iſrael. And this Deſtination may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Chriſt ordained to be the Meſſias, and to ſhew himſelfe to bee ſo in his appointed and deſtinated time. Now this Deſtination is indeed nothing elſe, but Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of a thing to bee which hath not either preſent being, or not fitly the time come for the uſe and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; but neither of theſe can be ſaid of the day on which God reſted, as is cleare by what is before gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Adverſaries.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Preſent Destination</hi> for time and imployment, ſo alſo as the thing <hi>Deſtinated,</hi> be for continuance, and may come to a greater ſolemnity, more at one time than at another: as for example to evidence it in perſons, places, and times.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 For perſons, the Levites were deſtinated to the ſervice of the Tabernacle, and were actually admitted to the ſervice thereof, preſently upon their choyce; for they were fit, and the time ſeaſonable for the uſe the Tabernacle.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 For places, when the Tabernacle was made, it was deſtinated to the ſolemne worſhip and ſervice of God, and was preſently employed; ſo was the Temple after <hi>Solomon</hi> had built it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 For times, <hi>Abib, Exod.</hi> 12. 2. was appointed the beginning of Monthes, and the fourteenth day of the Month deſtinated to the eating of the Paſſeover; and though it was to be continued for the times to come, and to bee obſerved with greater ſolemnity, yet then was it actually in uſe. So that with the inſtitution, there was the preſent obſervation, though with greater ſolemnity afterwards performed. Thus may we think of the firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath, ſo deſtinated for a Sabbath to be kept with greater ſolemnitie, after Iſraels deliverance out of Egypt; yet nothing hindereth to beleeve, if we take what before is granted, that there was a preſent obſervation of the day. What I finde to bee objected againſt this,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102301:11"/> is anſwered in this Section afterwards.</p>

                        <p>Solemn Feaſts, memorialls of Gods great mercies, were ordained in <hi>Sinai,</hi> but deſtinated to be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Canaan.</hi> So that between the inſtitution, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be a great diſtance.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Yet here is a great difference between a few yeers in one age, and many ages through out the old world, and the ages following for above thouſands of yeers. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There was at the time of the inſtitution of thoſe Feaſts, the time and place appointed when they were to be kept, but no ſuch thing in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> touching any future time, for the obſervation of it, for then the fancied deſtination had been clear, and the queſtion had been ended. Thirdly, There was no reaſon for the keeping of ſome of thoſe ſolemn Feaſts, as the feaſt of weeks, or of harveſt: <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. 22. becauſe in the wilderneſſe they did neither ſow nor reap: So the Feaſt of Tabernacles after the gathering in of corn and wine, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 13. becauſe then they dwelt not in houſes, to make them boothes, to remember that in the Wilderneſſe they ſo dwelt, for as yet they were in Tents in the Wilderneſſe; nor had they fields of corne nor vineyards to gather in corne and wine. Therefore there was reaſon for deſtinating the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe Feaſts till afterwards. But ſuch ſound reaſons of deſtinating the obſervation of the ſeventh day Sabbath for ſo many hundred yeers are yet to ſeek: The Paſſeover they kept when it was inſtituted, and after, in the wilderneſſe: <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 1. 5. and ſo no doubt other holy dayes then inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, ſuch as then could be kept.</p>

                        <p>The reaſon and ground of the obſervation of the Sabbath was not till Iſraels comming out of Egypt; <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. where it is ſaid, that Iſrael was a ſervant in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and that the Lord brought him out with a mighty hand; Therefore the Lord his God commanded him to keep the Sabbath day: We ſee hence, that the keeping of the day did depend on ſuch a deliverance; therefore we may well acknowledge a deſtination for the obſervation, till the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102301:12"/> ground of the obſervation become to paſſe, which was not till then.</p>
                        <p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> It is granted before, that the cauſe and reaſon for the Sabbath, was Gods reſt. Secondly, in <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 11. It is rendered as the only reaſon why God then commanded the obſervation of the Sabbath; Nor did God himſelf give any other reaſon or ground for the keeping of it holy, but only his bleſſing and ſanctifying of the day on which he did reſt: Therefore this was the ground of obſerving the day; which ground was laid down at the beginning of the world, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is acknowledged; and therefore there was no need of a deſtination to expect another ground for the obſervation of the day ſo many hundred yeers after. Thirdly, Concerning deliverance out of Egypt, it is prefaced by God himſelf before all the Commandments, as a ſtrong motive from his mercy, to move Iſrael to the obſervation of every Commandment, and not of the fourth alone: For upon the rehearſall of that benefit, the Lord gave them that his whole Law, conſiſting of ten Commandments. Fourthly, the former part of verſe 15. in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. is to be read as within a Parentheſis, ſo as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the later part of it, at <hi>therefore,</hi> muſt have relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>reſt</hi> mentioned in the end of the fourteenth verſe, and not to the deliverance out of Egypt, mentioned within the parentheſis, as the ground of the Sabbath: for (if it be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well) it beginneth with <hi>remember</hi> that thou waſt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to move them to pity their ſervants, as God in mercy pitied them, to bring them out of Egypt with ſo ſtrong an hand. So thus rightly underſtanding the text, it is altogether impertinent to be brought for deſtinating the keeping of the ſeventh day, till Iſraels deliverance out of Egypt. It is to be lamented that men of good Learning ſhould wrong Gods word with ſuch a Miſinterpretation, to uphold a meere ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Deſtination, which neither Wit, nor Learning can make good.</p>

                        <p>But the ſeventh day was from the beginning, the day of Gods reſt, and the ground of mans reſt; (this is granted.) And that day had its ability, and every way was as fit then for an holy Sabbath as ever it was afterwards. This is true

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> was to work ſix dayes (though his labour was delightſome, and not toyleſome) in imitation of God, and therefore to reſt the ſeventh day, becauſe God did ſo: This is reaſon enough, if no more can be ſaid for it: For albeit <hi>Adam</hi> toyled not his bodie with payn and ſweat, yet his mind was attent to his weekly buſſineſſe while he laboured, and ſix dayes were deſtinated to his labour: but now on the ſeventh day his bodie was altogether freed from all labour, and his minde alſo from attending to it, and the whole man ſet apart for an holy reſt unto the Lord, which befitted him well.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though on the other dayes he ſerved God, yet neither the dayes, nor he on thoſe dayes were immediatly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, as this day was, and held alſo for holy duties, and to attend upon God immediatly; who in that happy eſtate did in a viſible apparition manifeſt himſelf to him:

If the day was bleſſed and ſanctified of God (which muſt needs be granted, if the Anticipation and Deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bee removed) then a bleſſed and ſanctified day, agreed well to his holy and bleſſed ſtate of innocencie, not any jarre or unfittingneſſe comming betweene.</p>

                     <p>How can this be denyed? Doth not <hi>Moſes</hi> proceed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in his hiſtoricall narration?

That this is clearely ſo to be underſtood without a figure, I thus prove.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this third verſe is connexed to the ſecond by the

                        </gap>ration; ſo are his reſting, and his bleſſing and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the ſame ſeventh day, knit together, and ſo conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to every ones common apprehenſion, tied one to the other, as the other be without any difference in <hi>Moſes</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore if the former verſe be cleare, ſo is the later, to any not anticipated with a prejudicate opinion, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to errour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God himſelfe publiſhing the Law of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. doth there as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth here in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> 2. 2, 3. couple together the ſame things, his finiſhing of his work in ſix dayes <hi>(who made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is)</hi> with his reſting on the ſeventh day, and then, that <hi>he bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it:</hi> clearely thus verifying the truth of <hi>Moſes</hi> narration by his conjoyning of the things together, and then by ſpeaking alſo of all theſe his acts as then done in the time perfectly paſt, in the words, <hi>made, reſted, bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>ſanctified:</hi> therefore may we ſee God himſelfe (if we will ſee) teaching us to underſtand <hi>Moſes</hi> plainly, and that without any Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Deſtination.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſeventh day in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. is that firſt ſeventh day in which God reſted, and not another ſeventh day, which ſhould be 2450 yeares after, when the Law ſhould be given at Mount Sinai. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the conjunction <hi>and</hi> will not admit of ſuch a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or diviſion of the day in the third verſe, from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in the ſecond, to make them to be put aſunder as farre as the creation was from the promulgation of the Law, 2450 and odde yeares.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſeventh day is three times mentioned: twice
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102301:18"/> in the ſecond verſe, which is not denied to be underſtood of one and the ſame ſeventh day; and why not the ſeventh day in the third verſe? For there is no difference in the expreſſion of the day, it is called alike in all the triple mentioning the ſeventh day, and the later ſeventh day (as I ſaid before) is by <hi>and</hi> conjoyned to the other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the demonſtrative <hi>ipſum</hi> it, referreth us to the ſame ſeventh day before ſpoken of: For the word cannot have reference to a ſeventh day to come two thouſand yeares after.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the reaſon that is annexed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. tieth us to that firſt ſeventh day on which God reſted, and not to another ſeventh day to come after: for if the ſeventh bee underſtood of any other ſeventh day, than that on which he reſted immediately after the ſix dayes work, the reaſon ſhould not be good.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, to this firſt ſeventh day God hath reference in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. and to no other ſeventh day: Therefore muſt the words be underſtood of the firſt ſeventh day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to take the words, <hi>he bleſſed and ſanctified it,</hi> to be meant of that ſeventh day on which God reſted, hath no abſurdity in it, neither in reſpect of the day, nor in reſpect of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, as I have proved; nor doth it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any other place, nor any other Scripture can be brought againſt it, nor is there any untruth ſo to conceive it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the words without figure plaine and eaſie, and ſo to be underſtood as they be hiſtorically delivered.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But I deny here a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> for take away a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> and yet the ſenſe remayneth, and the former fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words are knit without any abſurditie: but take away theſe words, <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi> Gen. 2. 3.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there is no meaning left to expreſſe what benefit man ſhould have by Gods reſting on the Sabbath day, as <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth us, what benefit accrued to man by Gods working upon every other of the ſix daies: for as God wrought on them, and diſtinguiſhed them for mans uſe, even ſo muſt wee conceive of his diſtinguiſhing the ſeventh day, and reſting on it for mans good, as well as the other dayes. But if theſe words be a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and taken away, then had not <hi>Moſes</hi> told us of any uſe or benefit of this day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, take theſe words away, then the ſecond verſe, with the later part of the third verſe, will abſurdly bee conjoyned. In verſe ſecond, it is thus, <hi>And he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his workes which he had made.</hi> And in verſe third, it then ſhould follow immediately, <hi>becauſe that in it hee had rested from all his work, which God made and created.</hi> So hee reſted, becauſe he reſted.</p>
                     <p>But now if the whole third verſe be in the <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> then as I ſaid, the benefit of the day in which God reſted is taken from us, that is, the bleſſing and ſanctifying of it for our uſe. Therefore for theſe reaſons wee may not admit of a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> nor is there any ſuch thing in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, nor in the <hi>Greek,</hi> nor in <hi>Pagine,</hi> nor in <hi>

                     <p n="1">1 The name Sabbath, doth take its originall from Gods reſting on this ſeventh day: for ſo the word ſignifieth, <hi>ceſſavit, requievit.</hi> This alſo wee learne from the fourth Commandement in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. where God nameth the word Sabbath, which in the tenth verſe, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto this ſeventh day, and in the eleventh verſe, the reaſon is rendred, why it is called Sabbath, becauſe God reſted on the ſeventh day: So that Gods owne reſting on this day, made it a Sabbath.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It being by Gods reſting made a Sabbath day, hee did therefore bleſſe it: Now to bleſſe a day, is no where ſpoken of God in the whole Bible, but here; and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. And therefore by that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. wee muſt ſeek out the meaning of this in <hi>Genſis,</hi> which will appeare to bee this, that he bleſſed it, that is, by ſanctifying it; for the later word giveth the ſenſe of the former, the conjunction <hi>and</hi> comming betwixt <hi>benedixit,</hi> and <hi>ſanctificavit,</hi> is exegeticall, put expoſitively, as is uſuall in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſpeech, when two verbes come together; and very learned men thus expound the place. So <hi>Calvin, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus, Paraeus,</hi> and others; but to come to Gods owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. which is this: By his reſt he made the ſeventh day Sabbath; and it being a Sabbath by his reſt, he did bleſſe it, that is, ſanctified it, that is, appointed it to be kept holy, as it is in the words of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: For the better confirmation of this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt underſtand that the Commandement given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. is deduced from his reſting, bleſſing, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102301:19"/> this ſeventh day, ſpoken of in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. 3. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. for the Commandement of God is an inference from it thus: Becauſe I reſted, bleſſed, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the Sabbath day; therefore I command thee to keep it holy. Now albeit there be three words in <hi>Geneſ. Rest, bleſſed, ſanctified;</hi> yet in the Commandement, hee men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth only the word Sabbath, and the keeping of it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Firſt the word <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> hath relation to his <hi>reſt;</hi> then <hi>to keep it holy,</hi> hath relation to <hi>ſanctified,</hi> or <hi>hallowed it,</hi> in which is included the word <hi>bleſſed:</hi> For Gods bleſſing of it, is the ſanctifying and conſecration of the day to be kept holy to the Lord: And indeed, this was a great bleſſing of the Lord, for mans heavenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good many wayes.</p>
                     <p>This expoſition is ſtrengthened by <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. where it is ſaid, <hi>too morrow is the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.</hi> Here the word <hi>bleſſed,</hi> is not ſpoken of, as to call it the bleſſed Sabbath, but the word <hi>holy</hi> is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only, having reference to Gods ſanctifying of it, and including therein his bleſſing of it.</p>
                     <p>Now the words thus cleerely opened, they muſt needs argue the Inſtitution of the Sabbath. For firſt, here is a Sabbath made, which Chriſt telleth us, was for man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 27. Secondly, here is Gods owne example for mans imitation, as is evident in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. by Gods urging his own example for reſting on the Sabbath. Thirdly, here are his words of inſtitution, in that it is ſaid, <hi>He bleſſed it, and ſanctified it,</hi> that is, hee ordained it to bee an holy Sabbath unto the Lord, to bee dedicated to his own ſervice, as <hi>Moſes</hi> informeth us, before the Law was promulgated, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. Fourthly and laſtly, hee confirmeth it with a reaſon in the end of the third verſe of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Therefore it is the Lords inſtitution for to bee his Sabbath day, and to bee kept holy of us, as the Commandement alſo teacheth, and appointeth us to doe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Lord in the promulgation of the Law, doth fetch from this place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the originall of the Sabbath,

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 26. maketh mention of ſix dayes, and of the ſeventh day Sabbath, and telleth them, that God had given them the Sabbath: verſe 29. ſpeaking of it as a time before: For as ſix dayes were before, ſo alſo was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day the Sabbath, for when ſome did break it, ver. 27. the Lord faith, <hi>How long will ye refuſe to keep my Commandments and Laws?</hi> He would not have ſaid, <hi>How long</hi> for the breach only of the firſt ſeventh day Sabbath, if they had not done ſo long before.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102301:21"/> As for inſtance; God brought Iſrael out of Egypt, and great bondage; whereupon God frameth to them his firſt Commandment in the Law, and forbiddeth them to have any other God beſides him.

Even ſo here, God having reſted from his work, made the ſeventh day a Sabbath, bleſſing and ſanctifying it for man, (for it was made for man: <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 27.) though the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of keeping holy the Sabbath had not been publiſhed; yet Gods reſt, Gods example in reſting, and his bleſſing and ſanctifying the day for man, had been as a precept. <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſaith, the words are preceptive, and <hi>Marius</hi> a learned man, ſaith they were a Commandment. For Gods own example propounded to man for imitation, is as if he had ſaid, Do as you ſee me do: elſe it is to no purpoſe to propound himſelf to us for an example. And Gods acts in this nature <note n="*" place="margin">This way our Homily takes, teaching, that as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children we ſhould imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father in this.</note> imitable, and for mans uſe, binde men to make that ſame uſe of his acts, for which uſe and end he did ſo; as his bleſſing and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, for to keep it holy to him, did binde them to keep it holy, as Gods Commandment in the promulgation of the Law, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 8. grounded upon this his act, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenceth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The keeping holy the Sabbath day, is called Gods <hi>Law,</hi> before the Law at <hi>Sinai. Exo.</hi> 16. 4. For the Law in this place is the keeping of the ſeventh day holy, as a Law: for what Law in all the ſixteenth chapter was there elſe, by which God would try his people, concerning the keeping thereof, but the keeping holy the Sabbath? as the maine of the chapter touching their Manna, in gathering it the ſixt day, in Gods preſerving it from Worms and ſtinking, in Gods not rayning it on the ſeventh day, in <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to have them keep in on the ſeventh day, tended all to the keeping of the Sabbath to the Lord, which is the Law mentioned in verſe 4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some going out to gather Manna on that day, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102301:21"/> Lord rebuketh the people for refuſing of a long time to keep his Commandements and Lawes, ſaying, <hi>how long will yee refuſe to keep my Commandements and Lawes? Exod.</hi> 16. 28. In which words we may obſerve theſe things: Firſt, that the people had Commandements and Lawes before this time, and ſo before the giving of the Law at <hi>Sinai.</hi> Secondly, that the Lawes and Commandements were not mens, but Gods, for he acknowledgeth them for his owne, ſaying, <hi>my</hi> Commandements, and <hi>my</hi> Lawes. Thirdly, in theſe words is comprehended the reſt of the holy Sabbath to the Lord, of which he maketh mention in the three and twenty, five and twenty, ſix and twenty verſes, before the reproofe of the breach thereof in this twenty eighth verſe: For ſome going out to gather <hi>Mannah</hi> on this day, he taxeth them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to keep his Commandements and Lawes, which hee would not have done, if the ſeventh day an holy Sabbath had beene none of them. Fourthly, that theſe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and Lawes they had knowne, and had refuſed to keep for a long time before; for he ſaith, <hi>How long refuſe yee to keep them?</hi> Underſtanding among theſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Sabbath, which being reckoned among the Commandements, it muſt needs be of a binding power.</p>
                     <p>If any man aske me, where doe we before this time finde mention of any ſuch Commandements and Lawes?</p>

                     <p n="1">1. It muſt needs bee, that <hi>Adam</hi> obſerved it, elſe he did neglect the inſtitution, and Gods imitable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtirre him up to the ſame. Now if <hi>Adam</hi> did neglect it, it muſt needs be: Firſt, either of ignorance, which could not be, for as he knew the Lords work of ſix dayes, ſo could he not be ignorant of Gods reſt the ſeventh day, this he ſaw, being created before, though he muſt be taught the ſix dayes work, either by Gods ſecret inſpiration, or by inſtruction of his voyce: Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was not ignorant of this firſt inſtitution of the Sabbath. Secondly, if he neglected it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, it was no leſſe than contempt, which to conceit of <hi>Adam</hi> could neither ſtand with his ſtate of innocency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, nor with his ſtate of grace after his fall.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> did neither of ignorance nor knowledge neglect it, he then obſerved it: and if he knew it, and obſerved it, without all queſtion he would teach others to obſerve it, he being after the fall one of the holy men of God, a teacher and inſtructer of Gods people, as hee is reckoned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. amongſt the teachers in thoſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps will here ſay, it would eaſily be granted, that the words were binding, if it could bee proved, that <hi>Adam</hi> knew of this inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The works of God are wrought for man to know, and in knowing them, to acknowledge God in them, and to obſerve them, and to make that uſe of them, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth by them; This is an univerſall truth.</p>
                     <p>Againe, his works wrought, are to bee taken notice of,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102301:22"/> of the firſt to whom they may become obſerveable, and to whom they doe belong: This is undeniable.</p>
                     <p>All Gods works are documentary, and lead men to ſome uſe of them, as the Scriptures doe teach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam,</hi> created in the excellency of perfection according to the image of God, ſaw Gods workmanſhip of the world, and knew God in them, and well underſtood how to make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>But now that in ſix dayes God was creating all things, <hi>Adam</hi> could not know but by information from God, nor could he know the ſeventh day, to be the ſeventh day on which God reſted, but by his knowledge of the ſix dayes before it.</p>
                     <p>Yet after God made him, he knowing that God wrought ſix dayes, and hee beholding Gods reſt on the ſeventh day, by his excellent underſtanding, he could conceive that God in both, to wit, in his ſix dayes working, and in his ſeventh dayes reſting, made himſelfe a patterne for his imitation: for elſe what needed God to take ſo many dayes for working, or the ſeventh day for reſting.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the ſeventh day, Gods exemplary reſt is not only mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Gods bleſſing and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the day, not for himſelfe, for ſo to think were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, ſaith learned B. <hi>Lakes,</hi> but for man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 27. <note place="margin">In his <hi>Theſ.</hi>

                     <p>If ſo, then <hi>Adam</hi> muſt needs know thus much, elſe Gods bleſſing and ſanctifying of the day for <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had beene of none effect.</p>

                     <p>Here I might annex the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the number of <hi>ſeven,</hi> againe and againe, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Dove; <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 10. 12. and likewiſe (being come out of the Arke) in his ſacrificing an acceptable offering to God, on the ſeven and twentieth day of the Month, in which hee came forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 14. 20. 25. like enough to bee the obſervation of the firſt Sabbath in the new world; ſo let me conceive it, till any can ſhew me plainely the contrarie. Howſoever it was, we ſee the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>ſeven</hi> was obſerved herein by him, as being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the ſeventh day of Gods reſting, and ſanctifying it for a Sabbath: For I would faine know, why the number of <hi>ſeven</hi> ſhould bee ſo obſerved of God, and holy men, not only by <hi>Noah,</hi> but by <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſome caſes, except it were to minde them of Gods ſeventh day; the firſt time of the mention of ſeventh, which God ſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in making the ſeventh day his reſting day? As for the conceit of perfection in the number of <hi>ſeven,</hi> I conceive it to bee without ground of Scripture, except with relation to Gods ſeventh day, bleſſed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>

The Apoſtle telleth us, that an entrance was made into the ſeventh daies reſt, inſtituted by God, when hee had finiſhed his work, and reſted thereon, into which man entred and reſted, as alſo did the Iſraelites into the Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reſt by <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and ſo doe the Iſraelites of God into the ſpirituall reſt by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now as wee Chriſtian beleevers doe partake of our reſt, and as the Iſraelite beleevers enjoyed the Typicall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102301:24"/> reſt, ſo did the holy Patriarches and Fathers enjoy the ſeventh day Sabbaths reſt, and kept that reſt: for to what purpoſe elſe is that firſt reſt mentioned?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>Genebrad</hi> in his <hi>Chron.</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> held that <hi>Noah</hi> and the reſt of the Fathers did keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, once ſanctified by God, and citeth <hi>Rabbi Iohai, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rabbi Simeonis, Rabbi Moſes, Hadarſan,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Salomò; Aben Eſra</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. is alſo of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 It is moſt cleare, that God gave to the holy men of God, his Lawes to live by, his Charge, his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Statutes, and his Lawes, and they obſerved them: ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the prime Patriarch, who alſo was acquainted therewith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 5. The godly were followers of good things, walking with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 22. and 6. 9. They vexed at the ſinfull courſes of men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. 9. They preached againſt their impieties, <hi>Iude</hi> 14. 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. and God threatned deſtruction to the world therefore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3, 7. and accordingly did deſtroy them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 19. Now if God gave his Lawes, and reproved ſinne, and puniſhed ſinne; would hee amongſt theſe his Lawes (the particulars whereof are not mentioned) ſuffer his firſt inſtitution, his bleſſed and ſanctified ſeventh day Sabbath, to bee unthought of, and to bee neglected? May wee reaſonably think that the godly having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived other Lawes, and obſerved and kept them (as the Text ſayth they did) that they would careleſſely omit to obſerve this inſtitution of the Sabbath, amongſt thoſe his Lawes, Statutes, and Commandements?</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Before any feaſt mentioned by Gods appointment, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Elders of the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 18. could ſpeak of a feaſt to be kept unto the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 5 1. on which they were to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto the Lord, verſe 3. Now what Feſtivall day could this bee, but the ſeventh day Sabbath; for as yet, no other Feſtivalls were inſtituted. Therefore how ever it was, that in Egypt perhaps in time of their cruell bondage, and only towards the end of it, they could not obſerve
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102301:25"/> the Sabbath; this hinders not to apply it to the Sabbath, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the terme of a Feaſt and Sacrifice, becauſe it was better underſtood of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> than if peradventure hee had mentioned the name Sabbath, which they might keep in Egypt, in the dayes of thoſe Kings which knew <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> before the extremity of their bondage.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The fourth Commandement, and all words thereto added, telleth us that the Sabbath day was kept holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time that it was written in the Tables of Stone.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the prefixed <hi>Memento,</hi> telleth us ſo much, that it was before obſerved, and God would ſtill have it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept: for the <hi>Memento,</hi> hath reſpect unto the time paſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the manner of this delivery of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, may perſwade us to this; for the other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are uttered imperatively, ſo as they inforce the dutie, as in the fifth Commandement, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother;</hi> the duty charged, is <hi>Honour:</hi> and in the other Commandements, the ſin is forbidden, as, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take my name in vaine, Thou ſhalt doe no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. But now in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lord falleth not upon the maine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as to ſay, <hi>keep holy the Sabbath day;</hi> but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative ſpeech is laid upon the word <hi>Remember:</hi> ſaying, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;</hi> cleane otherwiſe than in any other of the reſt of the precepts; and the reaſon hereof is, for that hee had before inſtituted it, and it had been before obſerved of the Iſraelites, as in the next reaſon is clearely proved: Therefore hee ſayth not, <hi>keep holy the Sabbath</hi> as now inſtituted, but thus, <hi>Remember to keep holy the Sabbath,</hi> as if hee had ſaid, as it hath been before obſerved of you, and ſtill to bee kept holy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all the principall words annexed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, tell us of no new thing then impoſed, but what was well enough known and made uſe of before: as, firſt ſix dayes for labour, they were allowed before

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9 And laſtly, to make up all ſure; <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth us in plain words, that the ſeventh day Sabbath was kept, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 30. and that the people reſted on the ſeventh day, which he ſaith was a Sabbath to the Lord, verſe 25. the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord, verſe. 23.</p>
                     <p>Now this Text being ſo cleare, that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, except one dare ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> lyed. Some have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to darken the truth, and to becloud the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Sabbath, in the former inſtitution, and uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by being pleaſed to vent their erroneous conception, and to ſay (but without any ground of reaſon) that this Chapter <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. ſpeaketh of the firſt inſtitution of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>But for anſwer hereto, I doe deny that any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution can here be proved; and to make this cleare, looke into the Text, and obſerve two things; firſt, what God ſpake; ſecondly, what God did to finde an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: firſt God himſelfe ſpake of giving of Manna, alſo of gathering a certaine rate every day, and on the ſixth day twice as much, verſe 4. 5. 23. but in all this chapter, God ſpeaks not ſo much as one word of the ſeventh day Sabbath, nor doth he ſay, that hee bleſſed or ſanctified it, nor doth <hi>Moſes</hi> write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any ſuch thing of God in this chapter as he ſpeaketh of Gods reſting, bleſſing, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102301:26"/> it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. as hee ſhould have done, if any anticipation were there, with relation to this place: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what God ſpake in verſe 28. is implicitly of the Sabbath; firſt wrapping it up among his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Lawes given before this time, to them and their Fathers; ſo farre is he from inſtituting a Sabbath in this place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he reproveth them for the breach of it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready commanded before with other his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and precepts there mentioned. Now if God ſpake no words of the Sabbath, but what the people were to doe in ſix dayes, and eſpecially on the ſixth, God paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the very naming of the ſeventh day, and where he ſpeaketh of it implicitly, it is only by way of reproofe, to the people for tranſgreſſing and breaking of it: How can here be the inſtitution of the Sabbath? ſeeing God doth not ſo much as name it, but reproves the breach of it, which implyeth it to have beene before this time, elſe ſhould he have reproved them for a tranſgreſſion and a ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was no Law.</p>
                     <p>Next let us ſee what Gods acts were, whether they will afford an inſtitution. Firſt, hee gave them the Manna verſ. 15. but this bleſſing was only on the ſix working dayes; what is this to the inſtitution of the Sabbath? tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no more than his ſix dayes work in the Creation for the inſtitution of the ſeventh day for a Sabbath. Secondly, he preſerved the Manna, gathered on the ſixth day in the morning, from breeding of wormes, and from ſtinking, being kept over night to bee eaten on the ſeventh day: what is this to the inſtitution of the day? The bleſſing, was not the bleſſing of the day, but of the eating of the Manna on the Sabbath day, for which cauſe God did preſerve it, that they might keep the Sabbath before this time bleſſed and ſanctified, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that neither by any words of God, nor by his deeds, can here bee proved the ſeventh dayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us ſee what may bee gathered from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102301:26"/> 
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> for inſtitution of the Sabbath here in this time.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that hee nameth the ſeventh day, three or or foure times in this Chapter; which he ſaith was the Sabbath, but not as an inſtitution; neither could <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> inſtitute the Sabbath: for what God here did not, he could not doe: but he mentioneth here the Sabbath;</p>
                     <p n="1">1 As a reaſon why hee approved the peoples act, in gathering on the ſixth day two Omers; becauſe the next day the morrow after, was the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. Here is no inſtitution, nor reaſon alleadged for it, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. but it is brought as a reaſon for a thing of another nature, to approve of the collection of a double rate of Manna, on the ſixth day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He nameth it againe in verſe, 25. but occaſioned by the Manna, which was, that they ſhould eat the reſerved Manna, for that none was to be found that day in the fields; becauſe it was the Sabbath day, on which they were to reſt: So here is a reaſon, why they ſhould not goe and ſeek Manna, but to eat what was gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but no inſtitution of the day, but an appointment of the meanes uſed for to reſt on the day formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hee mentioneth it againe in verſe 26. to the ſame purpoſe, to keep them within on the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe ſix dayes the Lord would give it them to gather, but on the ſeventh day Sabbath, there ſhould none be found; which words make no inſtitution, but are an information for the preventing of the breach of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 He nameth it in verſe 29. upon the Lords reproving them for the breach of the Sabbath, by ſome going forth to ſeek Manna contrary to ſo much fore-warning given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> whereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> dealeth a little more roundly with them, as a man having authority: ſaying, <hi>See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the ſixth day the bread of two dayes; abide yee every man in his place, let no man goe out of his place on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</hi> In theſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt commands every
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102301:27"/> man to abide within, and that none ſhould goe out to ſeek it on the ſeventh day. Theſe be the only words of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand about the Sabbath in this chapter, which doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the day, but ſerve only to prevent the peoples ſinning any more in going out to ſeek it, as they had done. Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth two reaſons for his ſo ſtrict a charge laid upon them, which he would have them to ſee and conſider of, for the better reſtraining of themſelves from the breach of the Sabbath. The firſt is from Gods grace and favour, that he had given them the Sabbath: And the other is, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them on the ſixth day the bread of two dayes. Where out of theſe words let us obſerve two things. The firſt is, that the mentioning of the Sabbath commeth only in ſtill occaſionally concerning the Manna, and not of purpoſe to inſtitute a Sabbath; but wholly in all the foure places, it is ſpoken of, either of gathering the double rate of Manna, or of the eating the Manna reſerved, or of gathering Manna on every of the ſix dayes, or of tarrying within, and not to goe out to ſeek it when it was not to be found; and all this to this end, that the Sabbath might be kept more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of the people, as the event plainly ſheweth: For upon theſe conſiderations about the Manna, the people harkened to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and did reſt on the ſeventh day, verſe 30.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing, wherewith I will and may conclude my anſwer, is, (that which may ſatisfie any, not wilfully averſe from the truth) the change of the tenſe, in the two reaſons: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of Gods giving of Manna (becauſe it was at this time given whilſt the people were in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of Zin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 1.) ſaith in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Dat vobis,</hi> he giveth you in the ſixth day the bread of two dayes: but ſpeaking of the Sabbath, he uttereth the words in the preterperfect tenſe, <hi>Jehovah dedit vobis ipſum Sabbatum:</hi> The Lord hath given to you the Sabbath, as that ſame which was of old, which evidently declareth the Sabbath to have beene before this time, and not now at this preſent in this place inſtituted: For if it had beene now at this time given, as the Manna was, <hi>Moſes</hi> would have ſaid, he giveth you the Sabbath, and not, he hath given it.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:102301:27"/>
                     <p> Having thus anſwered this place of <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. yet one thing remaineth to be removed as a great block in the way; which is the ſilent paſſing over the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from the Creation till the rayning of Manna: and therefore they are bold to conclude from a meere Negative, that there was no obſervation of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p n="1">

                        </label> 1. I have proved the inſtitution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. which is enough to prove, that they ought to have obſerved, which if they did not, was ſin in them: but the reverence we owe to thoſe holy men of God, bindeth us to think better of them than ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I have ſhewed my reaſons why wee are to bee perſwaded that the Sabbath was kept of them, of more force to confirme this aſſertion, than ſuch a weak argument from the bare ſilent paſſing it over hiſtorically, can bee of any validity to refell it.</p>
                     <p>For as the hiſtoricall narration of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh nothing of the obſervation of the day, after the inſtitution of it; ſo we may finde after it was commanded on Mount Sinai, that no mention is made of any obſervation of the day in all the book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> nor in the book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> nor in <hi>Ruth,</hi> nor in the firſt or ſecond of <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor in the firſt book of the <hi>Kings:</hi> ſhall we therefore conclude, that in all this time, valiant <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Princes of the people, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Judges,</hi> holy <hi>Samuel,</hi> zealous <hi>David,</hi> and others, did not obſerve the Sabbath? In all the Hiſtory of <hi>Heſter</hi> no mention is made of God; will we therefore ſay hee was not then knowne or worſhipped of <hi>Mordecai, Heſter,</hi> and the religious Jewes?</p>
                     <p>God by his ſpirit directed the holy Penmen to write ſo, in ſuch manner, and of ſuch things, as he in his heavenly wiſdome thought fitteſt to make rehearſall of to poſterities, and not to embolden men to deny ſuch and ſuch things not to have beene, becauſe the Lord was not pleaſed to mention them. If we ſhould thus reaſon, what an ill face of a Church would we imagine to have beene in the world till <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes.</p>
                     <p>For the better clearing of this point, and to manifeſt the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102301:28"/> abſurd and impious reaſoning from the ſilence of Scripture in this ſort, I will divide the times from the Creation till <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then let men ſee the ſilent paſſing over of many things, and whether men dare to deny the obſervation of the Sabbath upon that only very ſelfe ſame ground.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Creation to the fall, how long, is uncertain, the Story is only in two chapters and no more: In this ſpace is not one word of <hi>Adams</hi> worſhipping of God, not a word of any holy duties practiſed: May we think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he performed no ſuch thing to God? If we be aſhamed ſo to conclude from the ſilence of the Scripture herein, why dare any deny <hi>Adams</hi> obſervation of the Sabbath, upon no other ground? ſeeing he knew it to be inſtituted, and had Gods example of reſting before him for his imitation?</p>
                     <p>But yee will perhaps ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> could not keep it, becauſe he fell before the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">

                        </label> Learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> is confident to affirme, that Chriſt took an humane ſhape, and conferred with <hi>Adam,</hi> and taught him how to keep the Sabbath to the Lord. And it ſeemes to me ſomewhat unlikely that God would ſuffer <hi>Adam</hi> to fall the very day of his creation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> was made the ſixth day, what time is not noted; let it be in the morning, it cannot be then; firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the things to be done before he fell: 1. All ſorts of beaſts and foules were brought to him to name them, every ſeverall ſort according to their natures, which took up ſome time. 2. He was caſt into a deepe ſleepe. 3. A rib was taken out of his ſide, and thereof the woman was made. 4. The Lord brought her to <hi>Adam,</hi> and married them, who ſpake of her, and of the conjunction of man and wife. 5. God put them into Paradiſe to dreſſe the Garden, and gave them a Commandement: all which took up ſome ſpace of time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the time of the temptation, the Serpents comming into the Garden, then the conference betweene him and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after betweene <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam:</hi> the temptation was not ſo ſuddenly begun and ended, as the ſhortneſſe of the Story may ſeeme to intimate.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:102301:28"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, the things done after the fall: 1. A confuſed ſhame of face to ſee themſelves naked: 2. Their ſowing leaves to cover their nakedneſſe: 3. Their hiding themſelves, which was in the coole of the day. 4. Their examination, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and then the ſentence after upon all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the caſting of them forth of Paradiſe. All which may give us to think, that theſe things could not well happen upon his day of creation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is not likely, that <hi>Eve</hi> would ſo ſuddenly ſtraggle from her husbands company, and ſo immediately to be ſet upon by the Serpent, as ſoone as they were in the Garden.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They could not conceive of the excellency of their ſtate of perfection, nor of the efficacy of Gods bleſſed image and likeneſſe in them, if they had enjoyed no time for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thereof: For what time could they have had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſcerne of each others excellency, to contemplate upon Gods creatures, to behold their glorious habitation, and to praiſe God for his goodneſſe, if they had fallen the ſame day.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The words of Gods approbation of all his works: <hi>he ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good, Gen.</hi> 1. 31. which approbation he gave of them at the end of the ſixth day: For upon the words written by <hi>Moſes</hi> of Gods ſeeing all things very good, he addeth, <hi>and the Evening and the Morning was the ſixth day,</hi> that is, the day naturall was finiſhed, for ſo the words are to be underſtood of every of the other five dayes, verſe 5. 8. 13. 19. 23.</p>
                     <p>Now God ſpeaking in the end of the ſixth day ſo well of all his works, if <hi>Adam</hi> had fallen on that day, and God had curſed the earth for mans ſin, how could it be ſaid, that hee ſaw every thing good, when through the ſin of man, all things on a ſudden came to be out of frame.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It cannot ſtand with the beginning of the ſecond chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall the firſt ſixth day: becauſe, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had mentioned in the other chapter the ſixth day conſiſting of the evening and morning; he begineth with a ſummary repetition of all Gods works. <hi>Gene.</hi> 2. 1. as yet without crack or flaw in them: ſecondly with mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102301:29"/> of Gods ending his work which he had made, and not marred again by curſing of it, as yet, <hi>Gene.</hi> 2. 2. Thirdly <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth us, how God reſted on the ſeventh day (to wit) from all his work which he had made. Now what is reſting, but the Lords ceaſing to create further any other things, than what he had created, and his pleaſureable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the full accompliſhment of his works done in thoſe ſix dayes? And his reſting was from his work made; ſo it was from his creating only, and not from puniſhing, as his reſting ſhould have beene, had man fallen before his reſt here ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. Therefore from all theſe reaſons it is very likely, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> fell not on the day of their creation. But now to returne againe to the point.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 From <hi>Adams</hi> caſting out of Paradiſe unto the reſtoring of religion by <hi>Seth, Gen.</hi> 4. 26. which was the ſpace of 235 yeares, which Story is conteined in one only chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>In this ſpace of 235 yeares, there is no mention of <hi>Adams</hi> perſonall repentance, of his faith, and love to God; not a word of his praying to God, of his worſhipping of him, or of any duty performed by him, unto God, or man; can any or will any conclude hence, that <hi>Adam</hi> failed in all theſe? No; why then, upon the ſame reaſon, dare any conclude no keeping of the Sabbath by <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that he obſerved it: eſpecially, ſeeing wee read of Gods reſting, and of the inſtitution and making it the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for man?</p>

                     <p>Now in all this time, for ſo many hundreds of yeares wherein lived many holy men, the ſonnes of God mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. yet not one word by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet downe of any publick worſhip, in offering ſacrifices, as before; not a word of any holy meeting any where, not a word of any good they did one to another, not a word of any thing worthy note of any of them, or of their children, ſave of <hi>Enoch</hi> and

                        </label> 1. Now the people hungring after food for the belly, <hi>Exod</hi> 16. 3. and the Lord determining that he would raigne <hi>Mannab,</hi> which they ſhould gather every day by a certrain rate, and on the ſixt day twice as much, the reaſon was, becauſe the ſeventh day was the Lords Sabbath, on which day the Lord raigned no <hi>Mannab,</hi> nor would he have any to go forth to ſeek it, for that it was an holy reſt unto the Lord: This was the reaſon of the mentioning of it, as appeareth by all that which is before delivered out of the Text.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Becauſe now they were a people openly ſeparated to God from all other Nations, and an holy people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6. Therefore aſſoone as he had delivered them, (within ſix weeks ſpace or thereabouts) after they came from <hi>Egypt,</hi> he took order for their keeping holy the Sabbath day, as a ſpeciall evidence of their holyneſſe before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102301:30"/> God; the breach whereof he reproved as the breach of all his Commandments and Laws, both then, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 28. and afterwards; in ſo high eſteem had God his inſtitution of his Sabbath: and no marvell, becauſe by the breach of it God is much diſhonoured, and in the obſervation of it. The three firſt Commandments of the firſt Table are kept in publike view before men; for in obſerving the Sabbath day, we profeſſe the God of Iſrael as the firſt Commandment teacheth, Then in aſſembling together, and worſhipping God, we do what the ſecond Commandment bindeth us to do: and when on that day we contemplate upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, take occaſion thereby to praiſe him, and ſhew an outward holy behaviour to advance his glory, we do what the third Commandment commandeth us to do: ſo that the holy obſervation of the day to the Lord, keepeth up a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick practice of all our duties to every Commandment of the firſt Table: therefore no marvell it was that God took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo ſoon for the keeping of the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Becauſe God intended not untill this time, to ſet out any glorious face of his Church hiſtorically unto us; but rather other things, happening in the courſe of times, from the fall, as in the Story doth appear unto this time.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Fall to the Floud, the ill fruits of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the increaſe of ſin to mans deſtruction is recorded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the Floud to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the planting of the world by people, with their preſumptuous ſinning, cauſing them to be ſcattered over the face of the earth, according to their diſtinct languages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From <hi>Abraham</hi> to Iſraels going into Egypt, God moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to record the carriage of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as private families (upon which the Church conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted) living among idolaters, as pilgrims and ſtrangers, while they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> till God brought them into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the entrance into <hi>Egypt</hi> to their mighty delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, God was pleaſed to inſtruct <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet down how <hi>Joſeph</hi> came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> his troubles and honour; how by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102301:31"/> him Iſrael came into <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Joſephs</hi> means; the peaceable reſt, there till another King aroſe, and then of their heavie bondage, till God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to free them.</p>
                     <p>But now God intending to make glorious his people, and his worſhip more publickly to be obſerved of all Iſrael at one ſet time weekly, <hi>Moſes</hi> relateth the Lords pleaſure concerning the Sabbath, not to have it neglected, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely to be kept as an holy reſt unto the Lord, according to Gods firſt inſtitution thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                     <p>And thus much for the <hi>Patriarchall-Sabbath,</hi> before the Law publiſhed upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THe Naturalitie of the Law is ſo much thereof, as by the principles of Divinitie in Nature, written in all mens hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and furthered by the common light of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. may be known and aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto. And this knowledge is more or leſſe, as Naturall men partake of that naturall light: for from hence ariſeth the difference in naturall men, and not from the common principles, which be one and the ſame in all men.</p>
                     <p>From this Naturalitie in the Law, it may be called the Law of Nature, not ſo as if it were the work of Nature, but for that its in every mans nature, God writing it in every mans heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. ſince the fall, at the time of the ſouls infuſion into the body, as God did to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall.</p>
                     <p>This Naturalitie of the Law conſiſts in generalls, and cannot reach to true Specialities, without ſome further help and better direction, yet by deductions it may go far towards the Specialities.</p>
                     <p>This ſerves to make all men inexcuſable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20.</p>

                     <head>SECTION. IV. <hi>Of the Externalitie or Poſitiveneſſe of the Law.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Externalitie or Poſitiveneſſe of this Law is the openly making known of Gods Will in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements given by word of mouth, and after written in the two Tables of Stone.</p>
                     <p>This Externalitie of precepts, the Lord added for his Church, unto thoſe generall rules, and principles in nature, and to that common light in all men.</p>
                     <p>For the Lord never ſuffered his Church to be only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by that light in nature, never ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, who having it in perfection, could not guide himſelf to it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we read, before <hi>Moſes</hi> days, of Gods Word, of his ſpeaking to <hi>Adam, Noah,</hi> and to <hi>Abraham, viva Voce,</hi> giving his charge, Commandements, Statutes, and Laws, of which the Lord maketh mention to <hi>Iſaac</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that in keeping theſe <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed his voyce, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 5.</p>
                     <p>This Poſitiveneſſe or Externalitie is to guide thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities, unto more Specialities, which naturall men could never rightly diſcover without this help of Gods externall precepts.</p>
                     <p>This conſiſts in the Letter, and written words of the Law in the Commandements, and the farther meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be learned from other Scriptures, to know what is contained in the ſhort precepts.</p>
                     <p>This Externalitie properly belongeth to the outward man, for the ordering of it.</p>
                     <p>And this Externalltie may be diſpenſed with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome precepts, though the naturalitie cannot: for this is written in every mans heart, but ſo is not this Externalitie.</p>
                     <p>We ſee Gods diſpenſation in ſome Specialities, as Gods allowing <hi>Cain</hi> to marry with his Siſter: alſo <hi>Polygamie</hi> in the Patriarches: In Gods commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102301:35"/> ſonne: In the Magiſtrate commanded to kill the offender: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 9. ſo in warre to kill, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 17. In his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iſraelits to rob and ſpoile the Egyptians, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 22. And what is it but a diſpenſation, when God raiſeth up ſome to ſpoile other? And that children may leave their parents in caſe of Marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 5. and that variance may be between them for the Goſpel ſake? <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                     <p>The Commandements of this Law in reſpect of the meer Externalitie, manifeſted in Specialities may be called Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive laws, as ſuperadditaments for Specialities of thoſe generals: as for example, Naturalitie teacheth me a God: but the Poſitiveneſſe telleth me that I muſt have only the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for my god: Nature teacheth to worſhip God, but the Poſitive precept forbids to make any graven image or likeneſſe thereby, to worſhip him, but to worſhip in ſpirit and in truth: Nature teacheth to honour God, the Poſitive Commandement forbids the taking of Gods name in vaine: Nature <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <p>It teacheth alſo that for the proportion of this time, the creature muſt depend and waite upon his Creator: who alone can make the work of ſix dayes ſerve to keep us ſeven.</p>
                           <p>By light of nature tis no way fit the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould preſcribe unto his Maſter, but rather the Maſter unto his ſervant; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ground of that diſtinction of <hi>ſervi a libere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </note> teacheth to have a time to ſerve God ſolemnly, the Poſitive precept commandeth a Sabbath day, and directeth us to the keeping of a ſeventh day Sabbath.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Spirituality of the Law is the ſpirituall extenſion of every precept of the Law beyond all that which the naturality reacheth unto, and above the ſpeciality of the Letter of the Commandements in the externalitie thereof.</p>
                     <p>I call it the Spiritualitie of the Law, for that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is only attained by the ſpirits ſpeciall illumination, and grace. And conſiſts not in the only bare knowledge of the minde touching the extenſion, but alſo in the hearts affection, drawn on along with the utmoſt extent of the underſtanding, to love what is commanded, to hate what is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102301:35"/> forbidden, to joy in obedience, to ſorrow for failings, and falls, fearing ever to offend.</p>
                     <p>This Spirituality is that which is promiſed of God in his Covenant of Grace, made with his People, to be written in the minde and heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                     <p>This is the reparation of that bleſſed image of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in wiſedome, holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29.</p>
                     <p>The Naturality is common to all, in and out of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Externality belongeth to thoſe in the Church, and in this reſpect may the Law be ſaid to be given only to the Iſraelits.</p>
                     <p>This all the outward children of the Church may attain unto, and others out of the Church by converſing with and coming among them, or theſe going unto them, or getting ſome of the wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Therefore to gather, that whatſoever we finde in their writing concerning God, and the things appertaining to him, to be all from their meer light in nature, will not hold for a ſound concluſion.</p>
                     <p>This Spirituality is proper only to the Elect; The firſt is by inſcription, but bettred by diligent improvement of thoſe principles and helps from the Church: The ſecond is by information, and bettered by good education, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction publikely and privately in the Church. The third is by the ſpeciall inſpiration of Gods holy Spirit in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of the means, and in the grace of Self-deniall which every one muſt come with that will be a true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent obſerver of the Law.</p>

                     <p>THE Commandement chargeth us with reſt, with this muſt we begin and keep the day, without this no Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: It hath it denomination from reſt: The day for the holy uſe of the reſt, is ſaid to be bleſſed: <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11.

Therefore this is the firſt thing, in the firſt place to be obſerved, in the keeping of the day holy unto the Lord, which is, by making our reſt holy to him, by imploying our reſt holily: For the day is kept for the reſt ſake, by Gods own example, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the holy uſe of the reſt upon that day, wherein we do reſt, and not for the days ſake, for without the reſt we could not keep the day; nor would God have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the day, but for that he reſted and made the reſt holy for holy uſes on that day. The Conſideration of this would cut off much prophaneſſe and make us better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the day unto the Lord.</p>

                     <p>THe Lord having impoſed reſt upon us, in the next place he enjoyneth us a day for the reſt: Time is neceſſary
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102301:38"/> for all things, and without time we cannot reſt: Nature and experience teacheth this.</p>
                     <p>This time allotted by God is a day, but in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement the day is not determinately ſet down, it pitcheth upon no certain ſet day; But the Commandement is, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day</hi> (to wit) what day ſoever, <hi>to keep it holy,</hi> So the holy obſervation of the day is the ſubſtance of the comet. This generality is agreeable to the Naturalitie of the Law.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Lord delivered the Commandement.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To lay down in it the naturality of the Law, aſwell as in the reſt of the Commandements.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. This was for an admittance of the Changeableneſſe of the day; For this Commandement being affirmative, and propounded in generall termes maketh it applicative to this, or that day, To this, while it remaineth, and to that which may come in the roome of it, when this is changed, and taken away: as thus.</p>

                     <p>To all the Commandements God made a Preface, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obedience to all of them, even from his Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his God, and the God of his ſeed after him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. calling himſelf, <hi>The Lord their God,</hi> in giving his Law, and remembring them of that their great deliverance, which he had promiſed alſo unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 14.</p>

                     <p>The words of God knit to this Commandement, have, no doubt, been added for the like purpoſe, even to be a Confirmation, and an eſtabliſhment of the Precept, and the perpetuity thereof, and to move us to keep it.</p>
                     <p>Yet nevertheleſſe of late, divers have endeavoured to fiſh out of the words, matter to change the nature of the Commandement, from Morall (as they ſpeak) to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and to take away ſo the perpetuity of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and there withall mens hearts, and conſciences from affecting and obeying it, as being no Commandement now obliging any Chriſtian, and ſo do they rob God of one of his Commandements ſacrilegiouſly.</p>

                     <p>Its very reaſonable to give God one day of ſeven.</p>

                     <p>AS we ſee it muſt be one day in the week ſo we by the Lord are directed to the ſeventh day in the week.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By God his free donation of ſix dayes to us, for to labour in, and to do all that we have to do: our common and ordinary buſineſſes muſt be all done, and ended in this ſpace: which ſpace he preſently after the Commandement allotteth unto us. He firſt telleth us, what and how many dayes in the week are ours, before he tels us which is the day that is his: 1. That ſo we might learn where to begin to finde out the Sabbath. 2. By appropriating unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſeventh day for Sabbath: <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſeventh day here ſpoken of is not that one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall ſingular ſeventh day of the Creation on which God reſted, but a ſeventh day after the ſix dayes given to us: For.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the ſix dayes allowed us, are not the very ſix dayes in which God created the world, which were gone and paſt, but only ſix dayes in likeneſſe and revolution, no more is this the ſelf ſame ſeventh day, but another in likeneſſe by revolution. So it is as if he had ſaid I allow the ſix dayes together for your labour in the week, be thoſe ſix dayes, what dayes ſoever begon and reckoned together; But the ſeventh day following thoſe ſix dayes is mine, <hi>It is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That firſt ſeventh day, and the firſt ſix dayes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt and ſecond chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are underſtood
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102301:41"/> by God in the words following as a reaſon added to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God, why he giveth us for ever ſix dayes, and reſerveth the ſeventh day alwayes for himſelf; becauſe he wrought thoſe ſix dayes, and reſted that ſeventh day, which words of God are not the reaſon of the Commandement, but of his giving us ſix dayes, and his reſerving to himſelf the ſeventh day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods concluſion concerning the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment helpeth us in this: For in the end he turneth his ſpeech unto the very words of the Commandement: ſaying, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it,</hi> He ſaith not, that ſeventh day, but the Sabbath day, (that is) the reſt of that firſt Seventh, as a Sabbath for ever, fall it upon another ſeventh day, whatſoever it be.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh day therefore is ever the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Gods irrevocable donation of ſix dayes unto us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By our acceptation of ſo many dayes in the week to our ſelves, from all times unto this day: If from Gods words in this direction here we dare without doubt or ſcruple take our ſix dayes, are we not then tyed to give him the ſeventh day by the like authority, who reſerved to himſelf at the ſame time, when he gave us our ſix that we ſhould afford him the ſeventh?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Gods propoſing his own example, as a perpetuall pattern to be followed of us, in his ſix dayes labour, and in his ſeventh dayes reſt; For ſaith (that ever honoured Biſhop <hi>Lakes)</hi> what time God himſelf took for his work, and for his reſt, the ſame did he aſſign to men, and made his pattern a perpetuall Law: In his <hi>Theſis</hi> the 8.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For that the ſeventh part of time God did chuſe to himſelf before before fall: and ſo Gods ordinance is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting as the world, a portion of time eternall, as the ſame reverend Father affirmeth in his 25 <hi>Theſis</hi> and 32. See alſo for this very fully Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his fifth Book of <hi>Eccleſ. Pol. Sect.</hi> 70.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe if a man had ſtood in his full perfection, not only our firſt parents, but all his poſterity, had obſerved the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102301:42"/> firſt ſeventh day: But ſin (not any Ceremony) made that day alterable ſaith the ſame Father, as it now is altered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recreation of all things by Chriſt; But yet is ſtill the ſame portion of time kept, a ſeventh day in the week.</p>
                     <p>This alterableneſſe of that ſeventh day, through ſin, is a reaſon why God, in giving the fourth Commandement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as (I have ſaid) the ſame in ſuch a generall manner.</p>

                     <p>THeſe ſix dayes are called working dayes, <hi>Ezek</hi> 46. 1. in them men are to labour, which labour is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doing work; and it muſt be all, and it muſt be thy work, ſo labouring to do all that thou haſt to do, that is, which by thy profeſſion, Art, trade, and calling belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto thee to labour in and to do.</p>
                     <p>The words are a permiſſion put only by a conceſſion: in ſix dayes may work be done, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 15. and not precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but as they have reſpect to the Sabbath day; for the better obſerving of it, when we neglect not our buſineſſe on the ſix dayes, nor deferre any thing thereof unto the ſeventh day.</p>
                     <p>For the Lord in the firſt Table commandeth mans duty to himſelf, and how to expreſſe his love to him; which is the ſum of the firſt Table, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, 37. and not what man ſhould do for his corporall and outward eſtate, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the ſecond Table.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in theſe words is a preparation for the Sabbath, and a prevention for hindering our ſpirituall reſt, and alſo our bodily toyle for our ſelves, in and about our ordinary calling, when the day of reſt is come.</p>

                     <p>The words therefore are only a reſtriction from ſome works, but not a negative forbidding of every work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception.</p>
                     <p>The works from which we are here reſtrained this day, are ſuch works, as upon other dayes we may do (and not the work of ſin, which never ought to be done) ſuch are ſervile mechanick works of our ordinary profeſſion, trade, occupation, and calling, lawfully to be done in the other ſix dayes, which thus I prove.</p>

                     <p>THat here we may not be deceived,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We are not to regard the writings of the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> of later times, infected with their own ſuperſtition, upon miſtakes of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt have recourſe to the Originall Sabbath, which the fourth Commandement propoundeth and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, as we may obſerve in the reaſon of the direction.</p>
                     <p>Now in that was no reſtraint unto <hi>Adam,</hi> but to reſt from his week dayes work, dreſſing the Garden: So now onely ſervile work in this directory added to the Commandement, is forbidden, as before I have proved, in <hi>Sect.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The inſtances of labour in the Old Teſtament, were not breaches of the Sabbath, nor ſo were judged, nor can be proved to be ſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Saviour Chriſt, the wiſeſt Expoſitor of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102301:45"/> Precepts, and the exacteſt obſerver of his Fathers Will, alwayes in all things, both by word and deed, telleth us that the Law of the Commandements laid no ſuch yoak upon them, in any ſuch rigorous ſtrictneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We muſt make a difference between the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, with the words annexed, uttered by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſome other precepts given concerning the Sabbath by him afterwards, but mediately by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people: for the one is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and admits of works, as I have ſhewed, but the other are tranſient, and for ſome uſe only for a ſpace occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally delivered, binding to more ſtrictneſſe for the time.</p>
                     <p>They that go about to lay upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> a rigorous ſtrict reſt on the Sabbath, from every leaſt work which might be done without travell or diſtraction, do it,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To difference them from us by our more ſuppoſed freedome and liberty, as if the Iſraelits had been tyed by vertue of the fourth Commandement it ſelf to a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſtrictneſſe, then we now are, ſo as they might do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing, no not to go out of their doores on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. And ſo to overthrow the Naturality of the fourth Commandement, and perpetuity of it as nothing belonging now unto us. And for this purpoſe one of late in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sabbath, and Lords day, in <hi>Cbap.</hi> 2. of the fourth part goeth about to prove this ſo great ſtrictneſſe: for he ſaith,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That none were to go out of their doores on the Sabbath day, not only not to make a journey, but not to go out to walk although ſoftly: And this he collecteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they might not go out to gather <hi>Mannah</hi> on this day.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. If it were not lawfull to go out on the Sabbath day, how was it that ſome found, in the Wilderneſſe, a man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſticks, and yet they blameleſſe: They went out, elſe had they not found him, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 32, 33.

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. But grant it had been ſo, yet know, that to labour for food, was in the nature of a weekly ſervile work; ſo that here is prohibited the ſix dayes labour for bodily neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they had then no need to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. He ſaith, that the Iſraelites were to prepare their <hi>Mannah,</hi> to bake and ſeeth, what they would on the ſixt day, that ſo they might prevent that labour on the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. So they might not belike, dreſſe, and make ready any food on the reſt day.</p>

                     <p>But if it had been ſo, the miracle had not been ſo great: for that which the people did reſerve without warrant and had wormes, and ſtank, was as they gathered it, and not either baken, or ſodden for any thing that can be gathered out of the text.</p>
                     <p>Again, the only bare mentioning of eating, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their not baking or ſeething, more then the bare naming of the peoples baking and ſeething will inferre their not before grinding of it, of which not a word there in the text: Its moſt like that which remained over, was ground with the reſt, either in Mills, or beaten in Mortars, as they uſed to do, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 8. and ſo the Meal thereof was reſerved to be baken or ſodden the next day; which if ſo, they abſtained from no other work, then ſervile, as we do, from carrying our Corn to the Mill to be ground of the Millerd, which is his weeks dayes labour.</p>

                        </label> I Theſe words, <hi>according to the Commandement,</hi> may be thus expounded, that is, as they underſtood it by the Jewes interpretation, ſuperſtitiouſly: For theſe godly women, being trained up by the then Doctors of the Church, obſerved the Sabbath as they had learned it from them: And albeit, the work was to the honour of Chriſt, yet for that it was not of neceſſity to be done on that day, nor at all, in reſpect of Chriſts body, but only a Cuſtome for an honourable buriall, therefore they did reſt from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that work on that day.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Take the reſt according to the true meaning of the Commandement, which impoſed reſt, this their reſt was according to the Commandement; and in that they did not this work, it was according to the Commandement, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding ſervile work, as the words in the Directory are to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>For they could not annoint him, but they muſt firſt buy their ſpices and oyntments, which they might not do, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling on the Sabbath being forbidden: That they could not buy them on the Fryday, as we ſpeak, is evident: For it was late ere Chriſts body was taken from the Croſſe, at even, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 57. then they did awaite, to ſee his buriall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 55. in which ſpace the Sabbath was come on: (for they reckoned, from the Evening, to the Evening) and therefore ſtayed they till after the Sabbath, to buy them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 1.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee his proofes, no proofes to argue any preciſe ſtrictneſſe in the words, <hi>(Thou ſhalt do no work)</hi> more to them then to us, by the Law.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Lord himſelf addeth a reaſon unto his former words, why he giveth us Six dayes, and reſerveth the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102301:49"/> Seventh to himſelf; for that in ſix dayes he made all things, and reſted the Seventh day.</p>
                     <p>In which words he layeth down, as an unalterable ground of apportionating time between God and us, which is his own example of working ſix dayes, and reſting the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, in the beginning of the world, which, as they be paſt and irrevocable, ſo is this portioning of time between him and us, to be perpetuall, elſe were his example thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in his Donation, and reſervation, to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>He in this dividing of the dayes of the week, thus between him and us, reflected upon himſelf, looked onely to what himſelf had done, and ſo gave ſo many dayes to us, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved onely one to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now what can be more permanent, than Gods own ſelf, in his own irrevocable Acts, from the worlds beginning, to be laid for the foundation of this his thus apportioning the week to us.</p>
                     <p>The Lord our God having thus laid down before them his unchangeable reſervation of the Seventh day for himſelf after his irrevocable gift of ſix dayes to us, he concludeth with theſe words; <hi>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Seventh day, and ſanctified it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its agreed on all hands, that here are the words of the Inſtitution of the Sabbath: not one of the late Writers gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth this, that I have read or heard of.</p>
                     <p>The main of the Controverſie is, that here is (ſay they) the firſt Inſtitution, the ground of the Prolepſis, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. and we ſay, they be a repetition of the Inſtitution, laid down before in that place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where no Prolepſis is.</p>
                     <p>For as the Lord here in the former words repeateth what he did in ſix dayes, and that he reſted the ſeventh day; ſo he repeateth his Inſtitution of the Sabbath then, what he did with the day on which he reſted, that is, becauſe he had finiſhed all his work in ſix dayes, and reſted the ſeventh day, he bleſſed and ſanctified it, to ſhew them here by this,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Antiquity of the Sabbath day, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Why he charged the Commandement of keeping holy the Sabbath day upon them among the other Precepts, and that alſo with a <hi>Memento,</hi> above any of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>For in the repetition here of the Inſtitution, the Lord kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the word, <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in the Commandement, ſaying, <hi>He bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi> and not as commonly we read it, he bleſſed the Seventh day, leſt any ſhould make that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall Seventh day, on which God reſted, to be of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Commandement, which God in his wiſdom (let it be well obſerved) left out in the Precept, and here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the repetition of the Inſtitution, and onely nameth the Sabbath, what Seventh day ſoever it be, either that for the time, or another in the room of it: which Sabbath is the bleſſed and hallowed day of the Lord, and ſo to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of for ever, as appeareth by all that hath been ſaid, if men be not diſpoſed to wrangle againſt the truth.</p>
                     <p>From all which is before delivered, its very apparent, that this fourth Commandement is no way Ceremoniall, <note place="margin">True, taking it in an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite notion, commanding the ſanctifying of one day in ſeven.</note> but a permanent Law to the worlds end, and not Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, as in the following Sections I ſhall make it manifeſt.</p>

                     <p>MEn diſpoſed to wipe out this Commandement out of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> fain would make it Ceremoniall; but their arguments, brought for this purpoſe, are of no validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: They ſay it was Ceremoniall,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. For the exact ſtrictneſſe of it, which they have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but I have proved it to be onely an imagination: For that ſtrict obſervation which was kept, was but for a time, and from acceſſory Commandements, not from the fourth Commandement it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102301:50"/> II. In their keeping of that ſeventh day: But the Seventh day is not of the ſubſtance of the Commandement; and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is proved to be perpetuall. Nor was the ſeventh in the firſt Inſtitution Ceremoniall: And the Church obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſtill a Seventh day.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. For that the Seventh day is abrogated, but this is not ſo, its changed, but not abrogated, as meer Ceremonies be.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It was a ſigne (ſay they) between God and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites: <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13, 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. God, in giving his Law, ſaith no ſuch thing: and ſtill we muſt make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Law it ſelf, and what after were added for inſtruction, as the then ſtate of the people required.</p>
                     <p>Again, every ſigne is not a Ceremony; for the Rain-bow was a ſigne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. yet no Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the reaſon added why it was a ſigne, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us, <hi>For in ſix dayes the Lord made beaven and earth, and on the Seventh day he rested, Exod.</hi> 31. 17.</p>
                     <p>The end why he made it, a ſigne doth a like appertain to us, to wit, That they might know him to be the Lord that Sanctified them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. And are not we to learn and know as much in keeping our reſt-day in holy duties? yea, bleſſed are they that do learn this leſſon, to know the Lord, that he doth ſanctifie them in the uſe of his Ordinances, upon the day of our reſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. It was a memoriall, ſay, they, of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 5. 15. This reaſon was <hi>Moſes</hi> addition to move the people to pity their ſervants and cattell: Muſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his charitable uſe made of the Sabbath, and his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade them to mercy, from Gods mercy to them, alter the nature of the Precept, and diſannull it? The words in the beginning of the verſe, may be conceived in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and are brought in onely as a memoriall of that great deliverance, as God remembred it in the preface to all the Commandements, to move them to obſerve the whole Law; and the word, <hi>Therefore,</hi> is to be annexed to the end of the 14 verſe, as indeed it ought in ſenſe and reaſon: which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102301:51"/> being ſo, the words prove not the Sabbath to be inſtituted for a memoriall of their deliverance from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> though they had good cauſe to remember it on this day, and in keeping the fourth Commandement, impoſing reſt, as alſo in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the firſt and all the other: for, as I ſaid, its in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the whole Law, as never to be forgotten of them, but to be remembred as a ſtrong motive, to ſtirre them up to obedience.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Say they, its ranked by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. among ſhadows.</p>
                     <p>But the place is not meant of the weekly Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The weekly Sabbath is the ſubſtance of the fourth Commandement: and therefore durable, not aboliſhed, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of theſe Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of ſuch things as cannot agree with the weekly Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Tearm, Ordinances, verſ. 14. ſhew where the Sabbath of the week is called an Ordinance?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The word, Ordinances, are expounded to be the Commandements contained in Ordinances: and theſe were the middle partition-wall between the Jew and Gentile, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away on the Croſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 15. But the Sabbath day was no part of the partition-wall between the Jews and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, for we keep ſtill a Sabbath unto the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are the hand writings againſt us, and contrary to us, blotted out, and aboliſhed, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 15. but not ſo the weekly Sabbath.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe were a ſhadow of things to come, whereof, the body was Chriſt, verſ. 17. but the <note n="*" place="margin">Generally the Fathers take it to prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Chriſts reſt, that day onely, full and wholly in his praiſe: as D. <hi>Andr:</hi> in his Star-Chamber ſpeech, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth.</note> Sabbath of the week was no ſuch thing: if we conſider it in it originall, and not of the declaratory, cloathed with it acceſſories, as BP. <hi>Lake</hi> ſpeaketh: for, ſaith he, before the fall, the Sabbath was a kinde of reſt, ſhadowing out our eternall reſt, but not of that whereof <hi>Christ is the Body.</hi> To us the Lords day is a foretaſte of that eternall reſt, and I hold the ſhadow to be as laſting as the world. Thus this lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">III. Here the Sabbaths are equalized, with meat, drink, holy-day, new Moon, which were the ſhadow of things to come.</p>
                     <p>Therefore hereby muſt be underſtood other Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>Such were theſe Sabbaths, the firſt day of the ſeventh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 24, 32. the ſeventh yeer, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 4. the yeer of <hi>Jubilee, Lev.</hi> 25. 8, 11.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe kinde of Sabbaths muſt be here meant,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Theſe were called Ordinances, as the Apoſtle calleth them here.</item>
                        <item>2. Theſe were of the partition-wall, and aboliſhed, and taken out of the way.</item>
                        <item>3. A ſhadow of things to come.</item>
                        <item>4. Thus the word, <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> taken, agree well with meat, drink, new Moon, and holy day.</item>
                        <item>5. The Apoſtle varying the number from new Moon and holy day ſingularly, to Sabbaths plurally, would have us to underſtand the annexed Convocations, called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 39. before mentioned.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Thus we ſee their arguments, what little ſtrength they have to prove the fourth Commandement Ceremoniall.</p>

                     <p>IT is clear enough that the fourth Commandement is not Ceremoniall not in part, as ſome do grant it, much leſſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102301:52"/> the whole, as ſome of late boldly affirm it to be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The inſtitution of the Sabbath, on which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is grounded, commanding no more, then at the firſt inſtitution, was before the fall, when there was no need of any Ceremony.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God never made himſelf an example of any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall precept, as he doth in this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A Ceremoniall precept conſiſts wholly, or in part of ſome Ceremoniall ſervice preſcribed by it; but no ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, neither in whole, nor in part, in this, neither in the day, nor in the ſtrict obſervation of it, as before is proved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All, and every Ceremoniall precepts, and politicall, were given mediately, only by <hi>Moſes, Levit.</hi> 27. 34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 14. But this was given immediately by God himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That which was Ceremoniall was properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the School-maſter to Chriſt: For the Ceremoniall Law was that proper, and direct School-Maſter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. But this precept is not any part of that School-maſter to Chriſt, properly and directly.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whatſoever was Ceremoniall, was Carnall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 16. and a beggerly rudiment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.

                     <p n="1">I.

So pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo reckoned in all the Church of God to this day, and by our Church, as before I ſhewed; But this is one of the Ten; Therefore a perpetuall precept to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the number, elſe ſhould there not be Ten, except with the Papiſts we could finde ſome other precept, to cleave it in two to make up the number: And the Ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being Gods Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. we may not adde thereto, nor take from it. For mans Covenant being once confirmed, no man diſannulleth, or addeth thereto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15. may any then take from Gods Covenant? if not, then as this Covenant is perpetuall conſiſting of the number of Ten Commandements, no fewer in the firſt Tables, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. nor in the ſecond Tables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 1. 28. nor more added, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22. Therefore this fourth Commandement one of them, is perpetuall as is the Covenant it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That which God did make of equall dignity to all the other perpetuall precepts, is perpetuall.</p>

Therefore the Commandement made upon the inſtitution, and the inſtitution ſettled upon unchangeable grounds, the Commandement muſt needs be perpetuall.</p>

                     <p>But the breaking of this fourth Commandement, in not keeping the Sabbath, makes men guilty of the breach of the whole Law, and of all the reſt of the Commandements.</p>

                     <p n="7">VII. This Commandement is perpetuall, for that the obſervation of the things therein commanded, are, by Gods appointment, in their uſe, the publike practiſe and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt neceſſary duties, of the three former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the publike upholding of the ſame: For the and holy reſt ſanctification of the day, being rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, is in the publike profeſſion of the true God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the firſt Commandement teacheth.

                     <p>So that in truth, the keeping of this fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the publike upholding weekly of thoſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, the practice and profeſſion of the principall duties thereof, which be perpetuall as the Commandements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be.</p>

                     <p>But thus are we to pray unto God concerning this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and that by the Direction of our Church, every Lords Day publikly: Therefore is it perpetuall, elſe we mock God in ſo praying. The holy and learned Biſhop <hi>Lakes,</hi> underſtands it of our Lords day grounded upon the fourth Commandement.</p>
                     <p>And who can think them to be of any other minde that added this prayer to this, and every one of the Commandments.</p>
                     <p>The Authors of the <hi>Homilies</hi> underſtood it ſo, it is more then probable, for that they call the Lords day, our Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and affirm it to be the Commandment of God.</p>
                     <p>It hath been underſtood of all ſo heretofore till of late, whoſe perverſe anſwers to it are but unconſcionable perverſion of it, and without ſoliditie; yea, ſome anſwers ridiculous and abſurd.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. That Law, is perpetuall, the breach whereof God hath puniſhed heretofore, and yet doth, and lately within theſe few yeers, with very remarkable judgements: For Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ſendeth for breach of his own Laws; if the Law were not in force, then were there no ſin, and there ſhould be no puniſhment; this our Homily taketh notice of. And albe it ſuch judgements might fall upon other dayes, yet let any ſober ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit tell me, why ſuch happen on theſe dayes ſo frequently, what may be the cauſe, but ſin and breach of this Commandment?</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. That Commandment which the Church of God hath from the beginning of it unto this day obſerved, as one of Gods Commandments that is perpetuall: But ſo hath this been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: For let any ſhew that any Church ſince Chriſt ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this as none of Gods Commandments: Who are they that ever durſt deny it, or ever attempted to expunge it out of the Decalogue? The Papiſts make it a Commandment of God, ſo doth our Homily, our Book of Common-Prayer, the Book ſet out by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, approved by one and twenty Prelates, and many Doctors, and by the Parliament, alloweth this for a Commandment, affirming that the breach thereof doth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102301:55"/> much offend God, and provoketh his wrath and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. Therefore it being ſo held to be one of Gods Commandments in all ages hitherto, it remaineth in all ſober mens account the Commandment of God. It cannot be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſay ſome, becauſe it is a poſitive precept. But I have ſhewed:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is in nature acknowledged both for ſubſtance and circumſtance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Albeit it were poſitive, it would not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould not be perpetuall. For a precept may be <hi>Poſitivum naturale,</hi> and ſo durable, for the poſitiveneſſe taketh not away the naturality of it, but it remaineth perpetuall, although the precept have further revelation, then the naturality thereof can extend unto: For the poſitiveneſſe, only accommodateth the naturalitie to ſome ſpeciall certainty. Again, albeit the precept be meerly poſitive, yet might it be perpetuall, as the Law to <hi>Adam</hi> of not eating the forbidden fruit: it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all mankinde, as we may ſee in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of death upon us, aſwell as upon <hi>Adam.</hi> Alſo, is not the inſtitution of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper poſitive, and not naturall; yet as durable as the world, to the ſecond coming of Chriſt: For here we muſt know two things, whether the Law be naturall, or poſitive, in which they do agree.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The authority of both is Divine, of both God is the Author, and both binde the Conſcience to obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The independancy of both: for neither have any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of mans will, either to eſtabliſh or alter them and both are in diſpenſable, and unalterable, by mans authority: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of both, are to be judged by Gods only will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, albeit they be not both alike in their Natures, in ſome things.</p>

Judaiſme was from the Jews, but the Sabbath was long before this name became peculiar to a ſingle tribe in <hi>Iſrael, Judah</hi> ſo called.

                     <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſuppoſe, wee that deſire for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, that his day be ſolemnly kept, none of ripe judgement will condemne us of Judaiſme, if they well underſtand either us, or themſelves, hereafter.

A ſeventh may be ſpoken of whole numbers, where a certainty is not determined, nor pitched upon, nor taken out, but where the number is no more but ſeven in a week (as none heretofore, nor any now count more) there ſix being taken out for us, the ſeventh is left, as a certaine day not to bee doubted of, for the Lord.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are divers opinions about the beginning and ending of this our Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Some hold it from midnight, to midnight; this is the judgement of very learned Divines: ſome ſay it beginneth in the Morning, and ſo holdeth on till the next Morning; not many of this opinion, as being weakeſt, and fartheſt from the truth. Some hold it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the Evening, and to end at the Evening: and of this judgment are many ancient Fathers, and ſundry Councels. And the ancient obſervation of the <hi>Saturday</hi> in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, as a preparative thereto, may ſeeme to confirme as much.</p>
                     <p>But I am perſwaded, if we keep the day from the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Evening, the conſciences of men neede not trouble them about any other curious ſearch: So that there be a religious preparation to it, and a religious care in ending of it, not ruſhing into it with unſanctified hearts, nor concluding it with profaneſſe: For the nights are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for bodily reſt, and the day for labour (as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>When the Sunne ariſeth, man goeth forth to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and work, untill the Evening,</hi> Pſal. 104. 22. 23. <hi>When the night commeth no man can work,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4. Now a day for labour amongſt the Jewes was twelve houres, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 9. from ſix to ſix, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20. 1. 2. 8. but otherwiſe it was from the beginning of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to the darke of the Evening, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 9. 14. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. And wee ſee in the fourth Commandement that albeit, as it is held, a naturall day doth comprehend the night and day, yet is that time only mentioned in which men are <hi>to labour, and to doe all that they have to doe,</hi> in the ſix dayes, which is on the day time, and not in the night. And ſo, as they do well who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102301:68"/> labour painfully and honeſtly in the day light, and take the night for their quiet repoſe and reſt in the ſix dayes: In like manner do they well, who religiouſly ſerve the Lord Chriſt in the light of the day, though the night before, and the night after, they thankfully take benefit of the ſame for corporall reſt. Neither doe we read, that any were complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, or puniſhed, as breakers of the Sabbath; but for their tranſgreſſion and ſinne committed in the day time. Our Saviour Chriſt honoured this our Lords day, with his viſible preſence among his Diſciples and followers on the day time: At the Sun riſing early in the morning, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 2. 9. then after in the afternoone, continuing till the day was farre ſpent towards the Evening, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 29. <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. upon the ſame day at ſupper time; yea, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it is probable to bee ſomewhat late within the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that ſpace properly called the beginning of the night, but not farre within. And wee read how the Jewes on the day time kept their Sabbath, and God appointed his ſervice in the Tabernacle and the Temple from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Evening ſacrifice, and had no ſacrifices in the night time. And thus was the Lords day kept, except up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome extraordinarie occaſions, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. and as afterwards in the time of bloody perſecution, but not in ſetled dayes of peace.</p>

If thus we doe, as we ought, on the week dayes, than much more on the Lords day, ſet apart for holy duties: The night of which day before, and the Evening after, are to bee more piouſly conſidered of, than the like times of the week dayes. Our <hi>Saturday</hi> halfe holy day, our Evening Prayer, as a preparative to the Sabbath, teach us to enter upon the Sabbath holily, and to take the nights reſt, not onely for repairing ſtrength of body for labour, as on working dayes, but to bee more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102301:69"/> fit to doe ſervice and worſhip unto God, without drowzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit: And in the end of the day, to behave our ſelves ſo, as it may appeare wee have received a ſpirituall bleſſing that day, and have increaſed in knowledge and other holy graces, in the uſe of Gods holy ordinance.</p>

And it is acknowledged of all, that the whole Catholick Church from that time, till this day hath duly obſerved the ſame.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Jeroboam</hi> deviſed a worſhip, which when he had done, he ordained a day for it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 32. 33. So did <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> deviſe an Idoll, and a worſhip for it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the dedication, and day of the ſolemne worſhip, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                        <p>The miſcreant Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as hee gave a Law, and preſcribed a worſhip, ſo hee himſelfe inſtituted his day for the ſame, and did not leave it to the arbitrary will and pleaſure of his Worſhippers to ordaine and appoint.</p>
                        <p>Therefore from all this I conclude, unleſſe Chriſt ſhould doe as his Father did, and be leſſe carefull of a day for the ſolemnitie of his ſet worſhip, than the very Idolaters, hee muſt bee the Inſtitutor of this day, which we obſerve to him: For it cannot be proved that at any time, in any age of the world, that any publick worſhip was ever invented to be obſerved, but the very Authour and Inventor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was alſo himſelfe the Inſtitutor of the day for that worſhip, not leaving it to any others will to appoint the ſame for him.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:102301:75"/> 2 If Chriſt left it to others, as to his Apoſtles, then either before his aſcenſion during his abode with them, which is abſurd to conceit, or after his aſcenſion; if any doe think ſo, then it will follow, that from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to his aſcenſion, the ſpace of ſix weeks, the Church had no ſet day under Chriſt publickly to doe him ſolemne ſervice. For the other ſeventh day hee took away by his lying that whole day in the grave: ſo that, if he appointed no other day for it himſelfe, the Church had then for that ſpace no ſuch day: But as I have proved, Chriſt bleſſed the day of his reſurrection, and in this ſpace from his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his aſcenſion, the Apoſtles and Church obſerved it. And therefore he ordeined it, and left it not to them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Wee are to underſtand, that there are ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances about Gods worſhip, which he hath ever reſerved to his own authoritie, and never left them determinable to any, but to himſelfe: ſuch bee theſe which doe concurre about the obſervation of the Lords day.</p>
                        <p>The firſt circumſtance of this kinde is, that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the very ſubſtance, for time of performing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, whether one day in a yeere, in a moneth, in a week, or whether a part, or ſome few houres of the day, be to be ſet apart for his ſervice, or the whole day bee his. The determination of this time, is ſubſtantiall, and God alwayes appointed the ſame: as the ordaining of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and other holy dayes ſet apart by God, doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond circumſtance, is that whereof there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſway or guide the judgement this way, or that way, but the will of God muſt bee needfull to the determining of it. Such a circumſtance is the proportioning of time, and reſt on the Lords day for Gods ſervice: For if reaſon could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it, then ſhould it bee the Law of nature, but by his written Law, and revealed will, hath God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it.</p>
                        <p>The third circumſtance, is that which is of univerſall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by all, which none but God can impoſe by his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie, to which all are alike equally ſubject. And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102301:75"/> ſuch an univerſall circumſtance is this for obſervation of this day, by all Chriſtian people, and by the generall conſent of the whole Church of Chriſt, in all ages. Therefore this day was not left to the Apoſtles to be determined, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly Chriſt would imitate his Father, and ſet a day for his publick worſhip, as he did: And can we ſuppoſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to bee leſſe carefull than the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or other Idoll Worſhippers, in ordaining a ſolemn day for his publick ſervice?</p>
                        <p>But if this day which we obſerve be not of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then have wee none; for all other dayes are the ordinances of the Church, and obſerved only by humane authoritie.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That which the Apoſtles did obſerve, not only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but by way of injunction and command from Chriſt here on earth, through the Holy Ghoſt, that hee ordained, and left it not to them to ordaine: But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did obſerve the Lords day not only by inſpiration, but by way of injunction and commandement from Chriſt here on earth, through the Holy Ghoſt: And therefore he left it not to his Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved from <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 2. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt Jeſus, through the Holy Ghoſt, gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to his Apoſtles, in which Commandements is included the Lords day, as before is proved: which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with the reſt, he gave them through the Holy Ghoſt (that is) he in giving them, did convey his holy Spirit into them, to make them to underſtand them, to retaine them in memory, to make conſcience to obſerve them, and to teach others to obſerve them as commanded from him: for ſo much theſe words, <hi>through the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> import, when hee gave them Commandements, and ſpake of the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God: So that <hi>through the Holy Ghoſt</hi> here is not meant, as afterwards the divine inſpiration of the Spirit directing them, as occaſion ſerved, to ordaine things expedient and profitable for the Churches of Chriſt, which he himſelfe immediately commanded not;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102301:76"/> but left them to them, as by the wiſdome of his ſpirit, they ſhould be informed.</p>
                        <p>But here is to be underſtood, the then operation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon them to receive the Commandemets, which at that preſent in his own perſon he gave them, which they ſhould obſerve, and teach others to obſerve, as his own Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as he himſelfe had charged them to doe in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 20. when (as here in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.) he was to depart from them, and to aſcend up to his Father. Of other things after Chriſts aſcenſion, the Apoſtles ſpake from the Holy Ghoſt by way of <hi>inſpiration,</hi> but of all theſe things before his aſcenſion, from the Holy Ghoſt by way of <hi>injunction,</hi> and Commandement of Chriſt. Note this well.</p>

                        <p>IF the ſeventh day was by Gods immediate inſtitution, then was the change of it into our Sunday by Jeſus Chriſt his immediate inſtitution: But the antecedent is true, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Ergo</hi> the conſequent. For no religious change hath ever beene made of any ordinance of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſcribed by him, but by God himſelfe, and by his own immediate authority: for if the inſtitution be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate by him, the change into another muſt be by the like immediate authority alſo: for he that ordaineth, hath onely power to alter.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Man cannot change ſuch an odinance; for, firſt it is complained of as a ſinne, for the people to change Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24. 5. The Jewiſh Church, in the time of Chriſt, and after, held it blaſphemy to teach, that it was lawfull for Chriſt to change the cuſtomes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they took (but miſtook) him to be but a meere man. Secondly, if any but God have authority to change his owne ordinance immediately appointed by himſelfe, then that authority is equall with Gods. But there is no ſuch authority, nor ever was (Jeſus Chriſt excepted) upon the earth: The whole Church, if gathered into one place, is of no ſuch authority: And if unſtable man could alter ſuch an immediate ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, what ſtability could there then be in them? or what tie of our conſciences?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All religious changes of every ordinance of Gods owne immediate inſtitution hath ever beene immediate by God himſelfe, and no inſtance can be ſhewed to the contrary in holy writ.</p>
                        <p>The Tabernacle was of Gods owne immediate appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 40. when it was changed, and the Temple erected in ſtead of it; this Temple was of Gods owne imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appointment. <hi>David</hi> minding to build it, and <hi>Nathan</hi>

                        <p>The time of celebrating the Paſſeover, was the fourteenth day of the firſt month by God himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6. which time durſt not <hi>Moſes</hi> diſpenſe with, nor allow any other day for ſome to keep it, without Gods immediate warrant, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 8. 11. Times and ſeaſons are in Gods hand, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 21. therefore for the month <hi>Tiſhri</hi> he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Niſan</hi> for the firſt month of the yeare, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 2.

Thus wee ſee Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for places, for perſons, and for time, being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appointed by God, cannot bee changed but by God. Therefore the ſeventh day, being the immediate inſtitution of God, could not be changed into another day, as now it is, but immediately by God himſelfe even by Jeſus Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. who when he was come in the fleſh, changed the place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20, 21. the Law, and Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. into the miniſtery of the Goſpel: Prieſts and Levites, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66. 21. into Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, and others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

                           </label> 1. This objection is made before, to which I have in part anſwered.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I anſwer further, that our book of Homilies telleth <note place="margin">In Homily of Prayer.</note> us againe and againe, that there is expreſſe Commandement for it: The Authors of this book ſay there is; The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay there is not: ſet one againſt the other. To the book all the Miniſters in the Church of England have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but not to this Objection againſt it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I anſwer, there is in the New Teſtament no formall expreſſion of any of the other Commandements of the firſt Table, neither of the firſt, nor ſecond, nor third, becauſe they ſtood in force, and therefore no need formally to expreſſe them: no more need was there for any ſuch expreſſion of this.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe the fourth Commandement ſtood ſtill in force, as well as the reſt: for firſt, Chriſt did challenge Lordſhip over this fourth Commandement, in his aſſumed humane nature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 8. to ſhew that in his ſtate of humiliation, hee loſt not his authoritie over it: Secondly, becauſe the changing of the ſeventh day into another day,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102301:79"/> was not the taking away of the fourth Commandement, but only the accommodation of the ſame Commandment to our Lords day, for the continuation of it ſtill. For if the fourth Commandement bee not obſerved in keeping of this our Lords day, then will it follow,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That either there is no fourth Commandement, and ſo not ten Commandements, which number hath bin obſerved without addition, or diminution, to this day, the ſpace of 3221 yeeres in Gods Church, both of the Jewes, and of the Gentiles: or elſe if it be one of the Tenne, as God gave it, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. for one of them, then have we lived in ſinfull neglect of this Commandement now this 1600 yeeres.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It will follow that Chriſt hath loſt his Lordſhip of it, or ſuffered one of his Fathers Commandements to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglected; neither of which may bee granted without indignitie offered to Chriſt, and his truth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That Chriſt had not come to fulfill, but to deſtroy the Law, contrary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. for if he neither kept the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day, but took it away, nor ordeined certainely in the roome of it another day, he had deſtroyed this Law.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 It alſo will follow, that the Sonne ſhould not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of all men as they have honoured the Father with the fourth Commandement, and with a ſet day by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his publick worſhip and ſolemn ſervice: But all men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 23. And therefore with this fourth Commandement, and with a ſet day by his appointment for his publick and ſolemne worſhip and ſervice ſhould he be honoured.</p>

                           <hi>Honour the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. This is a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſoever is King: The accommodation of that may be thus: <hi>Saul</hi> is King, this is not of the ſubſtance of the Commandement, yet while <hi>Saul</hi> is King, we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to honour King <hi>Saul,</hi> but in time <hi>Saul</hi> is taken away, nevertheleſſe the Commandement, <hi>Honour the King,</hi> is of force to another perſon in his ſtead, as <hi>David</hi> ſucceeding, the Commandement is, honour King <hi>David.</hi> The ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which bindeth me to honour the King, bindeth me to honour <hi>Saul</hi> while he is King: And when <hi>Saul</hi> is taken away, and <hi>David</hi> appointed in his ſtead, I am bound by the ſelfe ſame Law to honour <hi>David.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Even ſo is the accommodation of this fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy:</hi> this is the Commandement what day ſoever it be applyed unto. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation is, the ſeventh day is the Sabbath day to keep it holy: this the Commandement doth binde us unto, as long as the day is unchanged and not taken away: But the day being altered, yet the Commandement abideth, and is of forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>From whence here note, that as the taking away of <hi>Saul</hi> took not away the Commandement of honouring the King, and <hi>Davids</hi> comming in <hi>Sauls</hi> ſtead held up the practice of the ſame Commandement: Even ſo the taking away of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day took not away the authoritie of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and the bringing in of the Lords day in ſtead thereof, holdeth up the practice of it, and by it we are bound to obſerve this day, as the Jewes their day: And therefore may we pray as our Church teacheth us:</p>

                     <p n="2">2. What honour and dignity the Holy Ghoſt giveth unto a day, cannot by the authority of man be taken from it, to put it upon any other day: but the firſt day of the week hath by the holy ſpirit this ſuperſcription ſet upon it, <hi>The Lords day;</hi> therefore it is not alterable by any, to any other day, to call that the Lords day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the Church can change it, then hath the Church authority to weaken the grounds on which the obſervation of the day was firſt ſetled, but that ſhe hath not; or elſe can bring better reaſons for the alteration, elſe it were folly to alter it: but there never was hitherto, nor now is, nor ever ſhall be, any ſuch reaſon to alter the day, as there was for ſetling of the day (to wit) the bleſſed reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus; of the excellent glory of which work yee have heard before: Therefore the Church cannot change it into another day.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whoſoever changeth one thing for another, in matters of an high nature, muſt have equall power with the firſt Inſtitutors, or receive authority ſo to do from them: But the Church hath not ſuch authority in her ſelfe, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation from either Chriſt, or from his Apoſtles: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot change the day.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It hath beene ratified by many Synods, by ancient Councells, by Imperiall Conſtitutions, and Edicts of Kings,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102301:80"/> eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of Kingdomes and Countreys, as it cannot be altered.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The long continued cuſtome of obſerving it, from the firſt day in the Apoſtles time by the whole Primitive Church, and by all Chriſtian Churches ſince in all ages, for theſe 1600 yeares without any gain-ſaying, maketh it unalterable, it being obſerved upon ſuch grounds, as is before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, to what purpoſe is it for any now to hold the change thereof, when never from the beginning, there was ever any one particular Church, any Synod, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or any Orthodox writer in ancient times, attempted it; Nor ever durſt any power on earth goe about it. But all the holy Fathers, and piouſly learned have with free conſent endeavoured the ſetling and honouring of this day, as may appeare in their writings and praiſes of the ſame, as ſhall be manifeſt in the next chapter.</p>
                     <p>It is not therefore changeable, either abſolutely or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; <hi>nor have Chriſtians at any time,</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>White, judged it reaſonable or convenient to alter ſuch an ancient and well grounded cuſtome, which is commonly reputed to bee an Apoſtolicall tradition.</hi> To this let me adde in the laſt place, the judgement of that reverend Authour of the <hi>Antidote; That ſeeing the obſervation of the Lords day hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſo many Conſtitutions Eccleſiasticall and Imperiall, and hath withall continued with ſuch uniforme conſent through the whole Chriſtian world for ſo many ages, ever ſince the Apoſtles times, the Church (not to diſpute what ſhe may or may not doe</hi> ex plenitudine poteſtatis) <hi>ought not to attempt the altering of it to any other day of the week.</hi>

                     <p>Concerning the firſt, the ancient Sabbath was kept in reſt and in the employing of that reſt unto religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which what they were, ſee at large in the other Treatiſe, <hi>Section</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>For the Ceremoniall and Leviticall Services on that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, they are abrogated; ſo all the Jewiſh ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, brought in by mens vaine Traditions, are condemned, likewiſe thoſe acceſſorie precepts for the more ſtrict reſt on that day, belonging only to the Iſraelites for a time, are taken away and doe nothing concerne us, and are not to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of us. But the ancient people of God are to be followed of us, as farre as the fourth Commandement bindeth us in the naturalitie thereof, in the ſpiritualitie, and in its morallitie, as the holy people of God then kept it, in ſuch common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as wee are, as well as they were bound to performe for Gods ſervice, and for the benefiting of their owne ſoules, in the uſe and exerciſes of his heavenly ordinances on his holy day. This is farre from any Judaizing at all, ſo much laid in the diſh, and reproachfully caſt upon many in theſe times, but without cauſe at all: if the matter be well
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102301:84"/> weighed, and they rightly underſtood, as it were to bee wiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Their Service was both in the forenoone, and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone every day, <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 38. then much more on the Sabbath day: For in the morning of their Sabbath, they had the Service in the Tabernacle and Temple, and their Sacrifices doubled. <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 9. and alſo burning of incenſe in the morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 7.

It ordereth the Miniſters diſtinctly to rehearſe all the ten Commandments and the people kneeling, after every Commandment to aske God mercy for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of the ſame, and grace to have their hearts inclined to keep every one of them, and to write them in their hearts. Now the Fourth Commandment by this rehearſall of ten, and by the peoples prayer (except the Miniſter mocke the people and the people mocke God, and that by impoſed duty from authority, which God forbid we ſhould thinke) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: Firſt, To be a Law and Commandment of God, not onely heretofore, but now at this day. Secondly, To be one of the ten, which God himſelfe ſpake. Thirdly, That it is a Law and Commandment upon us, that make this prayer: Fourthly, That we are bound to keep it: Fifthly That of our ſelves we cannot be inclined in our hearts to keep it, till God incline our hearts unto it. Sixthly, That we ſhould have a joynt care together, to obſerve it from our hearts. Seventhly, That we are to acknowledge our ſelves tranſgreſſours of it, and ſtand in need to aske mercy of the Lord for the ſame.

                     <p>Now the Fourth Commandment requireth a day to be kept holy, as a Sabbath or reſt day: and therefore by this prayer are we to acknowledge it a Law to us, and all bound in heart to affect it, and to keepe it, as the Lord hath commanded us.</p>

It hath been the honour of our Church hitherto to outſtrip all Chriſtian Churches in the world in the ſanctifing of the Lords day. Our Common prayer book, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and Homily would hold us to it, if they had any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us.</p>

                     <p>King <hi>Athelſtan</hi> forbad buying and ſelling on this day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a penaltie.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Edgar,</hi> commanded every Sunday to be celebrated of every one from Saturday at three aclock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, till Munday morning at break of the day.</p>

                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, would have none moleſted either going to the Church to ſerve God, or comming from it.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in his time the ſhewing of Woolls ſhould not be made at the Staple on Sundayes, and on the ſolemne Feaſts.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, in his dayes, Fayres, and Markets, were forbidden, as an abominable injury and offence to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.

                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in his raigne were forbidden, as unlawfull games, <hi>Dice, quoits, tennis, bowling; as alſo the felling of ſhooes, bootes,</hi> nor <hi>was it lawfull for Shoomakers to put upon the feet, or pull on the legges any ſhooes or boots on Sundayes:</hi> In whoſe time it was judged, <hi>That ſale made on a Sunday of any thing, was not good, nor altered the propertie of it.</hi>

                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, it was in his dayes manifeſted by Act of Parliament, that the Sundayes were holy dayes, and other dayes there expreſſed, wherein Chriſtians ſhould ceaſe from all kinde of labour, and apply themſelves <hi>only</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> unto holy works properly belonging to true religion, which holy works were to be called <hi>Gods Service, whereunto ſuch times and dayes were ſanctified and hallowed</hi> (that is to ſay) <hi>ſeparated</hi> (marke it well) <hi>from all profane uſes.</hi>

                     <p>But as God inctruſteth by his word, ſo doth hee alſo <hi>by his works;</hi> he is ſaid to ſpeak by the work of his providence: <hi>Geneſs.</hi> 24. 50. 51. And when his judgements are in the <note place="margin">Eſai. 26. 10.</note> earth, the inhabitants of the world are to learne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereby: and even in this for not obſerving his holy day; for as before he puniſhed his people for the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102301:97"/> of their Sabbath, as the Scripture witneſſeth in many places: So hath the Lord puniſhed the prophanation of our Chriſtian Sabbath dedicated to his honour, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and hath pleaded by his puniſhments for the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, and to deterre men from the prophaning of it.</p>
                     <p>This we muſt know that there is no evill in a City but the Lord doth it, (to wit) the evill of puniſhment; and the ſame commeth for ſin, of what nature or kinde ſoever the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be: which are three fold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Immediate judgements</hi> wherein Gods hand is clearely ſeene, which all will eaſily acknowledge with feare; Such a judgement was the drowning of the old world, the burning of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire from heaven: So that of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> with the 250 Princes alſo with fire from heaven; ſuch a judgement was that of Lots wife turned into a pillar of ſalt, <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Gehezi</hi> made leprous: ſuch were alſo the ten plagues of Egypt on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and many judgements on the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe; and on other in Iſrael, and Judah afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Mediate judgements,</hi> which fall out upon men by ſome inſtruments, as by the hand of one man againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where one is the death of another: but theſe are not ſo deeply laid to heart, as to behold Gods anger therein, as men are bound to do, yet the Scriptures telleth us of ſuch, as Gods very hand in puniſhing men for ſin, as we may read of the falling out of great friends at firſt the <hi>Sichemits</hi> and <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 23. 56, 57.</note> who at length flew one another, God ſending an evill ſpirit between them to render upon their heads their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and evill they joyntly committed againſt the houſe of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> So hapned it with the three Armies of <hi>Moab Edom</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Chr. 20. 22. 23</note> and <hi>Ammon</hi> and their gathering together like friends, yet fell out one with another, to the ruine of themſelves, and this is attributed to be Gods hand upon them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Judgements commonly called <hi>Caſual,</hi> which happen not ſeldome, too many ſlight, and ſay, ſome, tuſh it was but an accident, as if Gods hand were not in it. When we reade of one killing another at unawares in <hi>Num.</hi> 35.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102301:97"/> 22, 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5. that ſuch a one ſo killed is delivered by God into the mans hand that killed him: <hi>Exo.</hi> 21. 13. By this kind of way came wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> to his death, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 34. even by a man ſhooting an arrow at an adventure: So <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his idolatrous ſonne by falling downe through a Latteſſe came to his end. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2. and 27000 by the fall a of wall in <hi>Aphekr.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 30. which no doubt the Lord overthrew and cauſed to fall upon them to ſlay them. And we muſt know that caſuall harmes, and death come for ſin, ſo our Saviour tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 4. that they were ſinners on whom the Tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, though others were not to judge them the greateſt ſinners above all: yea, caſuall loſſes in outward things come for ſin. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 37.</p>
                     <p>Therefore be the judgements of God of any kinde, they are to be taken notice of, and we are to make uſe thereof, to beware of ſin, and to repent leaſt we likewiſe periſh, and not to ſlight the leaſt caſuall harme as moſt doe: For <hi>Moſes</hi> remembreth the people of <hi>Miriam,</hi> and our Saviour willed <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 9. Luk. 17 32. 1. Cor. 10.</note> his hearers to remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets the examples of the puniſhment of the Iſraelites before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, and tells them that theſe things hapned to them for enſamples, and were written for our admonition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what puniſhments have heretofore fallen out, or now happen amongſt us, we are to obſerve them, and lay them to heart; For ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>All men ſhall feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the work of God, for they ſhall wiſely conſider his doing,</hi> Pſal. 64. 9.</p>
                     <p>That the abuſe of this our ſacred Lords day, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Hem. in Mart. 162. in Mark. 28. ſo in Luk. Ioh. and Acts <hi>Concio.</hi> 6. 9. &amp;c.</note> God to wrath is aknowledged; <hi>Gualter</hi> ſaith, it is not to be doubted, but that the prophanation of the Lords day is not the leaſt cauſe of the evills and calamities of our age. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth alſo that the Diſorders, Dances, Revells, and the like, on the Lords dayes and other Feaſtivals, were the occaſion of all publick calamities, and judgments, which they ſuffered; and reckoneth up, famine povertie, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, ſedition, &amp; concludeth thus in general, all plagues and ſcourges.

                     <p>Some on the Lords day would goe to Bowles (a forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den game to the common ſort) at which play two falling out, the one threw a bowle at the other, and ſtruck him ſo on the head, as the bloud iſſued out, of which blow hee dyed ſhortly after.</p>

                     <p>At a Wake on the Lords day, among others, two ſitting and drinking, till late at night fell out, but at firſt they were parted a while, after commeth one of them in againe, and ſeeing the other ſitting by the fire, with his back towards him, commeth behind him, and with an hatchet chineth him downe the back, ſo as his bowels fell out: the cruell murtherer flying, and being hotly purſued, leaped into a river and drowned himſelfe.</p>

                     <p>For it muſt indeed bee acknowledged that in this ſort of judgements the particular application to particular perſons for this and that act is not eaſie, but requireth prudency of circumſpection, and carefull obſervation of all circumſtances concurring to make a true uſe of them in the application to others, though not the like difficult in all, nor yet ſo hard for the parties upon whom ſuch caſuall judgements doe fall, to apply them home to themſelves for inſtruction. And therefore have they beene obſerved and recorded: Among very many, take theſe few examples.</p>

                        <hi>Teverton,</hi> (whoſe remembrance, ſaith mine Authour, made his heart to bleed) was twice alſo almoſt utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire, 400 houſes at once in a flame; and in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102301:100"/> firſt fire were about fifty perſons conſumed; which was for the horrible prophanation of the Lords day, occaſioned chiefly by their Munday-market. Of the firſt judgement they were fore-warned by their Preacher, telling them that ſome heavy judgement God would bring upon the Towne, as it hapned, not long after his death.</p>
                     <p>Two brethren on the Lords day in the forenoone came from a Market-towne to an Uncle they had, there to dine; after dinner they took horſe againe, but had not gone farre, but one of the horſes fell downe dead: who going back againe to their Uncles houſe, the other horſe being put up into the Stable, within an houre or two after died in the place.</p>
                     <p>One would ride after dinner on the Lords day, about a worldly buſineſſe, which he needed not then to have done; and therefore was diſwaded from it, but goe hee would, his way was over a bridge, on which when he came, a puffe of wind blew his hat into the river, which he ſeeking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by going into the river, both he and his horſe were drowned, nor could he be found till fiſhes had foulely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> report, that a husbandman grinding his corne on the Lords day, the meale was ſet on fire: And it is knowne to many, that a Millers wife ſetting her Mill on going, and ſhe buſie in her Mill on the Lords day, in the morning the Mill-houſe fell upon her, and kild her; of which by the fall of a Stone there, but a few dayes, or but a week before, ſhee had a faire warning given, yet not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good uſe of it, ſhe there ended her dayes.</p>

                     <p>I might here rehearſe many more caſuall judgements of many ſorts, which have hapned upon ſuch as have propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this day.

Some reject theſe and other like relations as fabulous, and ſo give no credit to them, holding them perhaps for <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> as formerly were the Popiſh legends to move feare in peoples hearts with telling of tales.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fore-mentioned examples are none ſuch; it is a foule ſinne to bely God, nor need his cauſe any lies to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it: we live now in a clearer light, than to be led away altogether with fabulous relations.</p>
                     <p>Others, becauſe ſome of the judgements ſeeme caſuall, and ſo commonly held in this very reſpect, make a tuſh at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of them: But however ſome be apprehended as caſuall, many being immediate from God, none but the Heathen Philiſtimes Prieſts will judge them meere chances: And for ſuch as be caſuall, let us conſider, that a Sparrow cannot light on the ground without the will, and providence of our heavenly Father. And are the haires of our head numbred? Certainly then, things which ſeeme moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, and ſuch acts as theſe judged ſo caſuall, muſt needs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102301:101"/> fall out by the will of God, and the guidance of his ſpeciall providence, and his divine hand. And therefore not to bee lightly paſſed over with a tuſh, and ſlighted as a meere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident without due obſervation, and uſe.</p>
                     <p>Some think, that there is not much heed to be taken of theſe judgements concerning this day, for that the ſelfe ſame may bee found to fall out at other times, and other holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes: And therefore nothing can be concluded more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly for this day, than for any other, from theſe judgements.</p>
                     <p>No doubt, but it may ſo happen and fall out, that a Drunkard may fall from his horſe and break his neck aſwell on any other holy day, as on the Lords day: A Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel-player may on another day be hurt, and have his eye ſtruck out as well as on this day: One may kill another, houſes may bee on fire, and men by ſwimming may bee drowned aſwell at other times, as on the Lords day: The like accidents may fall alike at all times; for God though he puniſh the prophanation of his owne day with his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet he reſerves not any ſpeciall judgements to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Sabbath-breakers, as peculiar to them for that ſinne: For if ſo, men would not thus diſpute the caſe, and ſleight the argument; for the judgement would clearely decide the controverſie, and put men to ſilence. But as I have ſaid, the ſame puniſhments may light upon all ſorts of offenders alike at any time: Nevertheleſſe, wee may not neglect to take good notice of Gods hand, not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to conceive where ſuch hurts, and harms happen, that there is ſinne which hath procured it, upon ſuch perſons as vaine, and ill diſpoſed (for we are to judge otherwiſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions on the Godly, which happen upon a <hi>Job</hi> for triall) but alſo to endeavour to finde out the ſinne in particular in a ſober ſearch and godly humility. And thus much muſt we doe for the work of Conſcience, which ſtirreth not upon an only generality; but upon knowledge of this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinne applyed home to our ſelves, upon the breach of ſome precept: Thus ſhall we inſtruct our ſelves by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judgements, to take heed of particular ſinnes.</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102301:102"/>
                     <p> Now to finde out the ſinne, and the ſinner in his ſinne, which God pointeth out by his hand upon him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Enquire into the tranſgreſſion of the Law, for by it commeth the knowledge of ſinne, which is the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law: upon this ground we cannot miſſe of the ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In the next place, ponder ſeriouſly all the concurring circumſtances concerning the puniſhment happening: And here note</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The notorious qualities of the perſon upon whom the judgement lights; whether he be a common ſwearer, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, fornicator, a deſpiſer of holy duties, or groſſely care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of them. 2 What evill he was ſaying or doing when the puniſhment befell him. 3 Where hee was, in what place prohibited. 4 His intention diſcovered to be nought, ungodly, or unjuſt. 5 How he did, or ſpeake in an evill manner. Laſtly, the time is very conſiderable when any ſuch thing was done, at what time the judgement hapned.</p>
                     <p>By all theſe concurring circumſtances duely weighed with mature deliberation, the divine hand may be obſerved very uſefully, even in common, and ſuch as be called caſuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: As for inſtance,</p>
                     <p>A May-pole ſet up on the Lords day, falleth and killeth one; one is ſet up upon a holy day in time of divine ſervice, which killeth another, as inſtances may be given: The firſt hapneth for the prophanation of the day, becauſe they brake the divine ordinance of God, who hath appointed the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and keeping holy of the day: The other, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane contempt of Gods divine ſervice on that other day. To play at foot-ball on the Sunday, the example is fearfull of fourteene drowned together playing on the ice, for that they prophaned the day: At <hi>Chidlington</hi> in the edge of <hi>Hertford-ſhire,</hi> not farre from <hi>Hitchin,</hi> upon an holy day a company of fellowes intended a match at foot-ball, ſome of them were come into the Church, and to call the reſt together, one tolled the Bell; preſently it began to thunder, and on a ſudden was ſeene a black ball to come tumbling downe a hill neare by, and came directly to the Church,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102301:102"/> and there flew into the Bell-Free, and firſt ſlew him that tolled the bell, then fluſtred about the Church, and hurt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and at laſt did buiſe in ſunder, leaving behinde it a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſtinch like to brimſtone. Now albeit this was not on the Lords day, yet were they thus fearefully puniſhed. Firſt, In plotting an unlawfull ſport, on that day againſt the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magiſtrate. Secondly, By making the Church, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated place, their randevouze. Thirdly, by prophanely tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bell, the principall uſe whereof, was to give notice to the people to come and ſerve God, and not to draw youths to vaine and unlawfull ſports. Fourthly and laſtly, in purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſpend the time, dedicated to ſacred uſes, in their boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, rude, and harmeful ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ting.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee how we may take notice of the judgments for breach of the Sabbath, though puniſhments of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (yea ſometimes worſe) happen upon other daies. To Conclude this, it is not good to take off our awefull thoughts from Gods hand, upon breakers of the Sabbath, leaſt we grow preſumptuous and fall into ſinne, and ſo procure to our ſelves the deſerved judgements which have light upon others: And let us conſider, how God threats to deſtory ſuch <note place="margin">Pſa. 28. 5.</note> as regard not his workes, and the operation of his hand.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſome are ſo farre from having any regard at all to this argument drawne from the judgements of God, as they hold the allegation of them, in this cauſe, to be impious raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, impious, and raſh preſumption, vaine obſervations, next allied to ſuperſtition, yea, a prophane kinde of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a ſtrangly preſumptuous and dareing manner to perke up into Gods throne, and a taking upon men to reade the darke and divine Characters of the cauſes of his inſcrutable judgements, and an unſufferable arrogancy in ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, making God to beare falſe witneſſe, fooliſhly triumphing before the victory, with ſaying, <hi>Loe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, Loe the judgements of the Lord, out of Heaven,</hi> making them ſpeake Gods indignation againſt the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>What ſhould move any thus to condemne, and cenſure
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102301:103"/> ſuch as bring Gods judgements againſt the prophaners of the Lords day; They may perhaps better know with in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than they yet have expreſſed unto others. If any have failed in trueth of Story, or related examples not to purpoſe (or what if but common, and ordinary, yet true yet may examples be memorable, though common and ordinary; for God makes them ſo common, becauſe he would not have them forgotten) or that have put <hi>Cauſam, pro non Cauſa,</hi> they are left to anſwere for themſelves. For my part, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without feare of mens fore-mentioned heavie doome, that we may with lowly reverence, and with an holy awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe of divine Majeſty ſoberly obſerve his judgements: and for thoſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Scriptures are full of examples of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to teach us to obſerve them now, as then they were: For whatſoever is written, is written for our learning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the things left us to read, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Our Saviour Chriſt minded his Hearers of the deſtruction of the old world, of Sodome, and of <hi>Lots</hi> wife to make uſe thereof for their inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth fore-paſt judgements, not <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> to the Jewes among whom they happened, but to converted Gentiles, the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> He nameth the ſinnes, and then the puniſhments, and telleth them, that they were written for enſamples, and for our admonition, that we ſhould not doe as they did. If judgements paſt, ſerve for this uſe, are we not to make the ſame uſe of judgements preſent, which dayly happen among us? I doubt not but we may, and ought ſo to doe.</p>

                     <p>Sixthly, I have ſhewed that 800 yeeres ago, how the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelates at the Synod in <hi>Paris,</hi> laid to heart the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgements which befell ſome, for the prophanation of the Lords day: <hi>Gualter,</hi> as you have heard, durſt averre boldly, confidently ſaying, that it was not to be doubted, that the prophanation of the Lords day, was not the leaſt cauſe of the evils, and calamities in thoſe times: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> durſt ſay as much. In the exhortation added to our <hi>Fast-Booke,</hi> is it not acknowledged, that the plague hapned (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſinnes) for the polluting, and not keeping holy the Lords day? Learned men from time to time have made Catalogues of ſuch judgements as have hapned upon this day. The Authour of the <hi>Practiſe of Pietie</hi> (a book thirty five times reprinted, allowed by authority, and dedicated to our Now Dread Soveraigne, when he was <hi>Duke of Yorke,</hi> and after when he was <hi>Prince of Wales)</hi> rehearſeth many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Sabbath-breakers, as he calleth them, and is bold in the Concluſion to affirme, that thoſe judgements which he mentioneth may be ſufficient unto them (whoſe hearts are not ſeared) how wrathfully God is diſpleaſed with them, who are wilfull prophaners of the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay of all theſe Reverend Fathers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102301:104"/> of our Reverend Prelates in their exhortation, of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines, aſwell Papiſts, as Proteſtants in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of judgments, and applying them for the breach of the Lords day, that herein they were ſtrangely preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that their obſervation was raſh, vaine, and impious, and they in ſo doing deſerved to be cenſured for inſufferable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy? now God forbid. I preſume, the ſpirit of wiſedome will not ſuffer any moderate minde to think it: nor ever did let any ſuch a condemning cenſure and deadly doome, paſſe the pen of any upon them for ſo doing. Nor indeed, was there cauſe, nor yet is, if the judgements be wiſely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>For is it not acknowledged by a learned Oppoſite, that in ſome caſes, it is lawfull to apply particular judgements to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinnes of particular perſons? Then why not in this caſe, if the caſe be put right, to wit, for the prophanation of the day, and not hailed and drawn to other by-ends, and by-reſpects, not intended in the production of theſe judgements? For another learned Oppoſite ſaith thus, without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (whether the obſervation of the Lords day ſtands by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods immediate precept in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwiſe: or onely by Apoſtolicall, or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Conſtitution) the prophanation of the day (marke the words) muſt needs bee a greivous ſinne, and powerfully-attractive of Divine vengeance, ſeeing it is acknowledged by all, that in the prophanation of that day, both Gods precept (as farre as it is morall in the fourth Commandement) is violated, and the authority (which God hath commanded all Chriſtians to obey) is contemned. If then the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the day be a greivous ſinne, and powerfully-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of Divine vengeance, when God layeth his hand upon the prophaners of the day, what letteth any ſober ſpirit to apply the judgement?</p>
                     <p>Gods wayes, are not our wayes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55. 8. ſaith one; true, not in his mercies, of which the Prophet there ſpeaketh; and yet we feare not to apply his mercies to our comfort, and to the comfort of others.</p>
                     <p>But the judgements of God are unſearchable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102301:104"/> what judgements? ſuch judgements as we ſpeake of? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh not of the works of his juſtice for ſin, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, mediate, or caſuall, which happen in the ſight of men, and are ſo made manifeſt, and are not unſearchable. But the Apoſtle by judgements underſtandeth the hidden determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods meanes to bring about the manifeſtation of his juſtice, and mercy to this and that people, as to the Jews, and to the Gentiles; which made the Apoſtle to cry out, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches of the wiſedome, and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the ſinne be manifeſt, and the puniſhment viſible, here is not an unſearchable judgement, nor ſuch, his way paſt finding out. Theſe two places alleadged, that of <hi>Eſay</hi> for judgements of mercies, and this of the Romanes miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and miſ-applyed to our matter in hand, do not hinder the applying ſoberly Gods judgements when they fall out upon men, in their ſinfull courſes.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour ſufficiently (will ſome ſay) taketh us off from this raſh attempt: 1. In the blind mans caſe, <hi>John</hi> 9. 2. In the fall of the tower of <hi>Siloam,</hi> and maſſacre committed on the <hi>Galileans:</hi> And 3. the whole booke of <hi>Job</hi> ſerves to ſhew the folly of vaine men.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the place of <hi>John</hi> 9. concerning the blinde man, there is no application of any judgement by the diſciples, they doe only ask him a queſtion, ſaying, Maſter, who did ſinne, this man or his parents? They knew not the cauſe, they only ſuppoſed, there might be ſome ſin, in the one, or in the other, why the man was borne blinde: Our Saviour anſwers them, and directeth their thoughts to an higher conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the occaſion of his healing: but he condemneth them not of any raſhneſſe as in ſome other caſes he did, when ſometimes they asked him a queſtion. This text taxeth not the ſober minded for obſerving ſinnes, and applying of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they happen.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Concerning, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. it is to as little purpoſe: for here ſome tell Chriſt of that which befell the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and our Saviour himſelfe bringeth in the fall of the tower: but here is no mention of the peoples apprehending
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102301:105"/> of any ſinne, for which they might apply to them the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor doth our Saviour finde fault with them for any ſuch conceit: but hee onely maketh a ſuppoſition, if any thought them to bee the greateſt ſinners aboue all others that dwelt in thoſe places, they erred in ſo thinking, and taught them the right uſe thereof, to wit, to repent, leaſt they themſelves ſhould periſh: This Text is againſt ſuch as raſhly judge ſuch to be the greateſt ſinners, who periſh by either mediate, or caſuall judgements; but who doe ſo judge of thoſe whom God hath puniſhed for prophaning his day? for my part I know none of ſo preſumptuous a ſpirit: we ſpeak of the ſinne, wee apply the judgement, and deſire men to make the uſe thereof, which Chriſt doth here, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that they may not likewiſe periſh; and this we have warrant to doe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for the whole book of <hi>Job,</hi> which is ſaid to ſerve for this purpoſe, to ſhew the folly of vaine men, preſuming to particularize the foot-ſteps of the Lord, as if hee proceeded in juſtice according to our fancies. I anſwer, all might well have been ſpared in this matter, for it maketh nothing againſt the obſervation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Gods judgements, againſt the prophanation of the Lords day. <hi>Job</hi> was a very holy man, his friends could not convince him of any open crime: and yet for the ſtrange manner of Gods afflicting him, they raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him. They reaſoned from Gods hand upon him, to make him guiltie of foule offences, which they could not juſtly taxe him of, for which <hi>Elihu</hi> reproveth them: But we reaſon from the ſinne, the prophanation of the day, (which is acknowledged a grievous ſin) to the puniſhment, that God is offended, and therefore the ſin to be a avoided. In this, is neither folly, nor we vaine men, nor led by fancie, nor doe wee darken counſell by words without knowledge, for <note place="margin">Iob 33. 2.</note> which God reproved <hi>Job,</hi> not <hi>Elihu</hi> for finding fault with <hi>Job;</hi> for <hi>Elihu</hi> his reprehenſion of <hi>Job</hi> was ſound, and good, <note place="margin">Iob 42. 3.</note> againſt which <hi>Job</hi> made no reply.</p>
                     <p>Oh, but yet ſome may ſay, if it bee denyed, that either the evill inflicted is a judgement, or that it was for this (to wit,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102301:105"/> the prophaning of the Lords day) inflicted, wee are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with put to ſhame, and ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Sooner ſaid than proved: Can any deny the evill befallen to be a judgement? For the better underſtanding hereof we muſt know the word judgement to be taken, two wayes; Firſt, for the extraordinary vindicative Juſtice, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full revenging hand of God, in his wrathfull vengeance, plaguing ſome notorions wicked ones, as the Sodomites, Egyptians, <hi>Jehoram</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> with a rotting diſeaſe incurable, ſo that he ſtank above ground, and the like; Secondly, for ordinary puniſhments, which may happen to any, ſo as the word judgement taken in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. where the word tranſlated damnation is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>judicium,</hi> judgement: ſo alſo in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17. it is uſed for any kinde of puniſhment which God infflicts upon men for ſin: In this later ſenſe the evill befalling the Sabbath-breakers, is a judgement, and a due deſerved puniſhment, as the word is expounded by the learned <hi>in Gal.</hi> 5. 10. Shall not fire from heaven, thundering and lightning, by which ſome have been killed, be held a judgement? was not the fall of Paris-gardens Scaffold, which hurt and kild ſo many, a judgement? Theſe and other evils hapning, ſuch as be before mentioned, have been held to be judgements; and why any ſhould deny them to be ſo now, they give no reaſon, nor indeed, can they, if they take the word judgement aright, as in this caſe ſome Oppoſites doe; who affirme that irreligious contempt of Gods ordinances, appointed on this day, by the Church, and law of the Land, may pull down Gods <hi>judgements:</hi> yea, that if this day were changed into another, there would be as exemplarie judgments of God from heaven againſt this kinde of ungodlineſſe of men, as ever were in any ages upon the Lords day. It is no ſhame we ſee to call them judgements.</p>
                     <p>And we may without ſhame ſay that theſe evils befell them for prophaning the Lords day, and not keeping it holy. Our Church in the Homily, and in the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exhortation, the Fathers in that Synod, and learned men have averred as much, whoſe affirmation may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to any private mans negation, if we had no reaſon to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102301:106"/> ſtrengthen the aſſertion. But is it not granted that the prophanation of the day is a grievous ſin? And doth not the fourth Commandement impoſe a morall dutie, which is to keep holy the day of reſt? The ſanctification of the day is impoſed upon us, and this are we preſſed to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Let the day be what it will, appointed by divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as our Lords day is acknowledged to be, wee are to keep it holy. To keep the day ſet apart by a divine inſtitution, holy, is the maine ſubſtance of the fourth Commandement, and a morall dutie: And therefore the not keeping holy the Lords day, but polluting it, is a ſinne, againſt the fourth Commandement, and the breach of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dutie, and therefore for this did the evills befall thoſe, that prophaned the day.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will peradventure ſay, that it was the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and irreligious contempt of Gods ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed upon this day by our Church, and the lawes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y to haſten their judgement.</p>
                     <p>And to this, ſome, it may be, will adde an other cauſe, to wit, the licentiouſneſſe of ſuch, as have bin puniſhed, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from thoſe dirrections &amp; limitation preſcribed to them.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny this neither, for certaine it is, that almoſt all the inſtances which lately have beene given, are of thoſe which have runne out beyond their bounds in the Declaration: and no marvell for ſuch as care not for Gods Commandements, will eaſily tranſgreſſe the limits preſcribed by man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But yet here is no diſcord in the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the cauſe of their puniſhment, the prophanation of the day: for in one and the ſame action, where God is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102301:106"/> diſ-obeyed, the Church diſ-regared, and authority neglected; and for all this together the parties puniſhed, yet the principall cauſe is the ſinne againſt God: as in this cauſe it is cleare enough.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe, ſome cannot peradventure be ſatisfied with all this, that it is lawfull to apply theſe judgements to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, except certaine rules be obſerved herein, ſuch as themſelves lay downe for guidance in the ſame. Theſe rules I will write downe, and then give anſwer to them as I may. The rules which I finde laid downe for this purpoſe are theſe following.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="rule">
                        <head>1 <hi>Rule.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>We muſt have either extraordinary revelation of the puniſhments for the ſinne, of which now there is no expectation in the wiſe: or immediately by the word wee muſt find thoſe particular ſins threatned with thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judgements, which we ſee to be executed upon them.</p>
                        <p>Sometime we finde in Scripture particular judgements threatned for ſome particular ſinnes, which ſome have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and beene puniſhed for. But there be above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſinnes mentioned in Scripture, and five hundred of them without any particular threatning added. This rule is not alwayes obſervable. Wee ſee ſeverall kindes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments inflicted for ſome particular ſinnes, which were not threatned before, to light upon the offenders. <hi>Uzziah</hi> for attempting to offer incenſe, was ſmitten with an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Leproſie: <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were burnt with fire from heaven for their ſinne: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their lying to the Holy Ghoſt kild immediately in the place: <hi>Jeroboams</hi> arme withered for ſtretching it out againſt the Prophet: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> for ſilencing a Prophet, given over to ſeck his owne overthrow: <hi>Judas</hi> for betraying Chriſt left to be his owne executioner: <hi>Herod</hi> eaten with wormes for his finne, yet none of theſe particular judgements were threatned for theſe particular ſinnes.</p>
                        <p>What therefore though we have no threatning that God would puniſh prophaneſſe on this day with ſuch particular judgements as have befallen them; muſt we not think thoſe evills to have happened to them for that ſinne? A ſinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102301:107"/> puniſhment, but what way and how God will puniſh, that hee reſerves to himſelfe, and ſeldome hath revealed it, though ſometimes as we ſee by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 11, 12. and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites, againſt <hi>Korah</hi> and his company, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 30.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="rule">
                        <head>2 <hi>Rule.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>That which we ſuppoſe to be puniſhed, muſt bee truly, and indeed a ſinne, and not a point diſputable, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations on the Lords day, whether lawfull, or unlawfull, are diſputable: and therefore without unſufferable arrogancy we cannot apply the evils happening as judgements for ſin.</p>
                        <p>No truth is ſo cleare, but by agitation, ſiding, and exerciſe of wit, may become diſputable. This might bee ſhewed in many things evident enough, till they come into queſtion. The morality of the fourth Commandement was heretofore very manifeſt, and the keeping holy the Sabbath day was of the morality, and the not-keeping holy the Sabbath day, but polluting it, was a ſinne. The Lord in the old Teſtament threatned to puniſh, and did ſeverely puniſh the breach of that Law; and the ſame ſinne hee yet puniſheth in ſome, though not in all that prophane the Lords day, obſerved of us Chriſtians, as our Chriſtian Sabbath, as hath been proved.</p>
                        <p>If theſe judgements come not for the prophanation of the day, (as before I ſhewed it hath been acknowledged) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God ſo long, and ſo often laid his hand on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? If God be not provoked to anger, hee will doe us no hurt. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 6. Hee doth not willingly afflict nor greive us. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. Therefore when hee doth hurt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict theſe vaine, looſe, and licentious ſort of perſons on this day, what ſinne (for they doe ſinne) evidenced by Gods hand againſt them, what ſinne, I ſay, may wee ſuppoſe it to bee, but their prophaneſſe? and if the caſe bee ſo doubtfull as ſome would make it, yet whether is it not better to make this uſe of theſe judgements, to ſanctify the day with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, rather than in doubtfull caſe to take our pleaſurable liberty? for the rule is good, <hi>Quod dubitas, ne feceris,</hi> for ſo we are ſure not to ſinne.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="3" type="rule">

For as an Oppoſite in this our caſe, ſaith, are there not thouſands (more is the pitty) that prophane the Lords day in greater meaſure, than any of thoſe in whom inſtances have been made, which never felt any exemplary evill? So may I ſay of many other ſinnes, and ſinfull men wallowing in their filthineſſe; where finde we that ever and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or for the moſt part, that vengeance ſuffers not a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer to live? Have not many lived, and do not many live guilty of bloud? hath ever, and continually, and for the moſt part, the drunkard, the glutton, the adulterer, the cruell extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, and the like wicked ones, been made exemplary by judgements upon them, that any ſhould expect ever, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, or for the moſt part, judgements upon Sabbath breakers?</p>
                        <p>But it is a pretty cunning for men to deviſe rules out of their owne braines, and lay them downe as <hi>Maximes</hi> to try their Adverſaries tenents by, and to reject them as not ſound, becauſe they agree not to their crooked rule.</p>
                        <p>Yet concerning the matter in hand let me ſay thus much, the ſo frequent accidents as ſome call them in ſo great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and happening ſo thick together in many places, may worke amazement, and do anſwere better to the rule, than what other ſinne with following judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offenders may be produced: It is ſaid, (and but ſaid,) that ſuch accidents fall out as frequently upon other dayes: Let them that ſo ſay be pleaſed to take the paines to obſerve, and gather a Catalogue, and preſent them to the view of the world to give ſatisfaction.</p>

                        <p>When the ſinner is taken in the very manner, the Lords hand may be obſerved therein, the ſinne co-operating with the judgement, either naturally, or morally.</p>
                        <p>When the ſinne, and the judgement meet together, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain, that the judgement then points out the ſin, which is at that time committed, to be the cauſe of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whilſt <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> was laying his hand upon the Arke,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102301:108"/> he was ſtruck dead, therefore the touching of the Arke, was the cauſe of the judgement: <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offered ſtrange fire, and whileſt they were offering, fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Num. 10. 1. 2.</note> light upon them, therefore the offering ſtrange fire was the cauſe why this fire from above was ſent down upon them. Plagues fell upon the Philiſtimes whilſt they deteined <note place="margin">1. Sam. 5.</note> the Ark therefore the withholding the Ark was the ſin which made God ſo to plague them, and was not a Chance. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> joyned himſelfe with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> to make ſhips to go to <hi>Ophir</hi> for gold, but were broken at <hi>Ezion-Geber,</hi> which <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22. 48. 49</note> caſuall croſſe befell him for that ſin as appeareth by the uſe <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> made of it afterwards, for he made not a tuſh of it but refuſed to joyne any more with <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> ſervants: the Prophet alſo applyed that caſuall puniſhment to that ſin. The Holy Prophet did not lightly reckon of ſuch a hand of God, but was taught by the Lord to obſerve it, and to apply <note place="margin">2. Chr. 20. 37.</note> it to the particular ſinne. Many other inſtances might be brought to confirme this trueth if need were out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore this being a rule certaine, then the hand of God may be obſerved againſt our Sabbath-breakers; for their prophanations did co-operate to the hurt of many, and to the death of ſome: They were puniſhed in their actes and deedes doing. It is not the queſtioning to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doubtfull, that can overthrow the rule laid, nor ſickneſſe, nor death happening when any are about a good thing; for the good thing, co-operateth not with the ſickneſſe, nor with the death following: preaching and praying procure not hurts, nor evils, and therefore cannot be produced fitly for this caſe, to take the ſober minde off from obſerving Gods puniſhments upon ſuch as we ſpeak of in this diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>It is a truth undeniable, that the true eſtimation of things dependes not upon the events or accidents following it: for where the acts be apparantly good, the ill events and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents concurring, cannot make the good to become evill, nor to be ſo judged in any wiſe mans underſtanding, nor the party afflicted to be judged ill of, in his good act, by men charitably-minded. But on the contrary, if evill events, and ill accidents meet with ill deedes, there the offenders may
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102301:108"/> without the breach of Charitie, be judged to bee juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And I ſuppoſe that evill events and ill accidents, happening very often where acts be done which be ill, in great probability, may probably witneſſe Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſuch as ſo doe evill without prophanely making the Lord to beare falſe witnſſe with us in ſuch a caſe.</p>

Thirdly, God muſt not looſe his right of ſervice from us, becauſe we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to our ſelves wretched natures, ſoone weary of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties. Fourthly, lazie ſervants can hardly undergoe any labour, much leſſe to hold out a day, yet the awe they beare to their earthly Maſters maketh them to doe it: ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102301:110"/> ſhould Gods feare move us to this. Fifthly, Imperfections through corruption of nature are one thing, for they bee in the beſt: but to nouriſh them, and willingly to yeeld unto them, is another: I cannot doe what I ought by nature, will I therefore not endeavour to doe what I ſhould doe by grace? God forbid. Sixthly and laſtly, let me ask any pious heart, any conſcionable Chriſtian, why ſhould men be more indulgent to weak nature, yeelding to fleſh and blood, in and about the fourth Commandement, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a day wholly to him, than in and about our whole ſervice and obedience to any of the other nine? Seeing God hath made his diſpleaſure ſo remarkable in many judgements againſt Sabbath-breakers, both aforetime under the Law, and now ſince under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Let me againe ask, is there any true Chriſtian and lover of Jeſus, but will out of conſcionable and mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approve of ſuch a pious and heavenly obſervation of the day, as the before mentioned reverend father ſpeaketh of, yea and count them moſt happy that could delight themſelves in ſo heavenly a manner, for the only honour and glory of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>If ſo, then let me once more be bold here to ask: Firſt, why are any derided, mocked, and abuſed with the oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious name of <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> who ſeek thus to extoll and magnifie the Lord of life without Jewiſh ſuperſtition? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why ſhould any bee offended with the endeavour in any to keep ſtrictly the day, though they cannot attaine to the perfection of it? ſeeing it is not reprehenſible; no Scripture againſt it, no Fathers reproving it, no Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning it, nor any holy men cenſuring it, as Judaizing in any age, ſince the glorious Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt?

Thus we ſee what ſports are on this day to be laid aſide; And if ſo, I hope well, the day will be better employed of many.</p>
                     <p>Let it not be offenſive to any that I propound theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to their pious conſiderations, to leave their paſtimes this day.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Scripture forbidding the doing of our own waies, finding our owne pleaſures, and ſpeaking of our owne words <hi>Eſay.</hi> 58. 13.

This ſcripture is the only place in holy writt which teacheth us how to keep a Sabbath ſpirituall unto God, by teaching firſt what to avoide, and then what we ſhould be taken up with, on this day (to wit) with an honourable eſteeme of the day, in conſidering whoſe day it is, Gods holy day; then what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we take in it, as a Sabbath day, and count it honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo doe him honour, ſhewing that we delight our ſelves in the Lord, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. This text ſpeaketh firſt, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">☜</note> proper to the Jewes, but what is common to us, in keeping our Chriſtian Sabbath with them. And therefore the Prophet doth mention onely the Sabbath day, and not their ſeventh day. Now Chriſt is ſtill Lord of the Sabbath, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 2. Here is nothing ſpoken but what is durable for ever, in keeping an holy day to the Lord: which is, Firſt, That the day be held an holy day. Secondly, That it be of the Lord. Thirdly, That it be a reſt day. Fourthly, That we delight in it and eſteeme it honourable. Fifthly, That on this day we honour him, not doing what we pleaſe, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our ſelves, do what he would have us to doe, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102301:113"/> ſo to manifeſt our delight to be, that day in the Lord: In all which I would faine know what is there that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us in keeping our Chriſtian Sabbath? Thirdly, the ſcope of the Prophet tendeth as well to us, as to them: for as in the former part of the Chapter, he had laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the abuſe in their Faſts, ſo here the abuſe in their Jewiſh keeping of the Sabbath externally in an outward ſervice, and reſt, mixing withall their own wayes, pleaſures, and ſpeeches, but did not keep it as holy to the Lord, in a ſpirituall manner, with delight to honour God, as they ought to have done. Doth not this tend to the reformation of keeping our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as moſt doe, as the Jewes did theirs, externally, mixt with our own wayes, pleaſures, and ſpeeches, but not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with a ſpiritually delight in the Lord? Therefore this Text is fitly urged by our Learned Divines for the religious obſervation of our Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The force of the fourth Commandement, is yet of continuance, and bindeth us, as in the former Treatiſe hath been proved, on our Lords day; and firſt to a reſt, then to the imployment of that reſt to an holy uſe, and ſo to keep the day holy. But ſports and paſtimes are not (to ſpeak properly) any reſt, nor are they any holy duties for which we reſt, thereby to keep the day holy to God: Therefore to be forborn this day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is reaſonable in all equitie, to give God one day whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him for ſpirituall worſhip and ſervice, and for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good of our own ſoules for ever, who hath given us ſix whole dayes for our own ſervice, and for our outward and worldly eſtate concerning our bodies, which be here but for a time: why ſhould wee then grudge to forbeare ſports for one day, denying God his own right, and our poore ſoules their ſpirituall good, for to ſatisfie the corrupt minde with corporall delights on this day?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The libertie of ſports, pleaſures, and paſtimes, on this day, ſteale away the heart from God in time of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: The thoughts of theſe pleaſures choak the ſeed of the <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 14.

So that the thoughts of them doe not only hinder in time of hearing, but doth quite take away the heart, from after-meditation, private prayer, and conference, without which hearing for the moſt part becommeth fruitleſſe. Now if this libertie were reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they ſet to ſinging of Pſalmes, and other Chriſtian, and heavenly recreations (as <hi>Durand</hi> before calleth them) they knowing whereto they ſhould hold, they would bee more attent in the Church, and better exerciſed out of it: eſpecially, if they were made to know, that not to ſerve the Lord God with joyfulneſſe, and with gladneſſe of heart, doth not a little anger, and provoke God to wrath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 If ſports, and paſtimes have any allowance from God, it is either Legally or Evangelically. But not Legally, for the letter of the Law bindeth ſtrictly: Not Evangelically, for albeit the rigour of the Law, be mitigated by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and wee by Chriſt freed from the curſe thereof, yet nevertheleſſe we are tyed in love, and in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to the uttermoſt of our power, withall our hearts, mindes, ſoules, and ſtrength, to ſerve him, and to take the benefit of ſuch times, as bee ſet apart for his glroy, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to be taken up therein with ſpirituall delight in ſuch ſervice to the Lord our God. For grace is more binding by the Goſpel upon the regenerate, than the Law can bee forceable upon naturall men: If therefore the Law doth not admit of idle ſports on the Sabbath, then much leſſe the Goſpel, which doth more enlarge our hearts with the love of Chriſt, and more forceably takes us off from making any proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof, if in truth it be powerfully in us.</p>

                     <p n="7">7 Nothing is more warrantable to be done on this day, and on this our day under the Goſpel, than was on their day under the Law; underſtanding the Law in its originall, and ſet apart from the acceſſory precepts added thereto, and durable only for a time. But under the Law, no ſports or paſtimes for corporall pleaſure were allowed on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and therefore to be forborne on this day: For, concerning ſports on their Sabbath, wee read not in any place of the old Teſtament, either for allowance or practice thereof. Indeed, we read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 6. 18, 19. of eating, drinking, and riſing up to play, ſinging, and dancing; but it was upon a day made for the ſervice of the golden Calfe, and honour thereof, but condemned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7. and greivouſly puniſhed by the command of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. 28. we alſo read (but when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102301:114"/> dances pleaded for commonly be, contrary to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in holy writ. We may alſo heare what that learned Biſhop <hi>White</hi> telleth us, how the Rabbins out of the <note place="margin">Page 138.</note> 
                        <hi>Talmud</hi> affirme, that it was permitted yong people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and ſport themſelves upon ſome part of the Sabbath, with running, leaping, or dancing, provided that it bee in honour of the Sabbath: Note this well, then not for meere <note place="margin">☜</note> corporall recreation, as our youths uſe their ſports. But what credit can be given to theſe late Rabbins? For it is well knowne, that the Jewes in the time of the Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came prophaners of their Sabbaths, by revelling, and the like, as learned Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> witneſſeth; and therefore their example not to be imitated or regarded.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Needleſſely to doe on the Lords day, what may (if out propably) hazard ſinning, and ſo the provoking of God to anger, is a great preſumption that the hearts of ſuch are not poſſeſſed with that holy feare, which maketh men ever jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their doings, leſt peradventure they ſhould at any time offend God. But for ſuch to ſport on the Lords day, as have vigour, ſtrength, and health, to expreſſe the bodies acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in their pleaſurable delights (for of ſuch the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie only is) it is needleſſe, whether you reſpect their bodies, or their mindes, and ſpirits. And therefore of ſuch are ſports to bee forborne this day.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>They are not needfull for the body:</hi> If the body hath loſt any ſtrength by weekly labour, ſtirring ſports, and paſtimes which are commonly performed with violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot repaire the loſt ſtrength. Firſt, they are not the ordinary meanes appointed by God for recovery thereof, but wholſome food, quiet reſt, moderate ſleep, good phyſick, and the like, as the cauſe ſhall require. Secondly, ſports, and paſtimes are commonly ſo violently purſued, as mens bodies grow thereby the more weary, and ſo in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring, decay their ſtrength. Thirdly, for ordinary and common refreſhment, for the reviving of the body to returne with more lightſomeneſſe and alacrity to work, God hath given the painfull labourer reſt and ſleep in the night, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dayes labour a nights reſt, for ſix dayes, ſix nights, as in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102301:115"/> his wiſdome he thought fit; and ſufficient, according to that in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 22. 23. Man works on the day, and reſts at Evening. But now for bodily ſtrength, if weakned by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the weeke before, to refreſh it for the weeke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a man hath firſt the Saturday night, then the whole Sunday from ſervile labour, and laſtly Sunday night, two nights and a day for corporall reſt, ſo that to an healthy body apt for labour recreations, ſports, and paſtimes this day are needleſſe, for if every nights reſt in the week day can by Gods bleſſing preſerve ſtrength, recover the decay of it, and make it apt for new labour, then much more two nights and a day, if we pray for a bleſſing thereon. Fourthly, The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons addicted to ſporting may be reduced to three ſorts, either to induſtriouſly-painfull, or to ſlack-handed, idle and lazy in worke, or to the holy day perſons, ſuch as either have little or nothing to doe, living idlely like Droanes in an Hive upon the ſweat of other mens brows, inordinate livers not worthy to eat: Theſe laſt neede no recreations but rather a whip for correction. The ſecond ſort are either rich mens children, <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.</note> (not wearied with worke whoſe labour is rather a loytering than painfull diligence) or ſlouthfull ſervants; ſports, and paſtimes to theſe two rather increaſe in them idleneſſe than a will to work, for theſe commonly are they which follow moſt after ſports: And experience telleth us, that ſuch as moſt love pleaſure, are the leaſt takers of pains, the greateſt Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and the lazieſt work-men, and labourers. The third ſort which get hardly their living with the ſweat of their brows, poore men, and their poore children crave qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et reſt, and not painfull paſtime. For ſports are often perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with greater labour of the body than the work of a mans vocation. Reſt is beſt for theſe; and ſporting, and paſtime needleſſe in reſpect of their bodies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>They are not needfull for the minde and ſpirit:</hi> For what good can ſports, gameing, and paſtime, afford man in this reſpect on this day, after he hath been in Gods houſe? Can they ſharpen his deſire to returne more chearefully to delight in holy duties? It is impoſſible, and the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is found by experience in ſuch as turne the Sabbaths
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102301:115"/> holy reſt, and their time, which ſhould be for meditation, into pleaſureable recreations.</p>
                     <p>They cannot this day ſet an edge on, nor ſharpen the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make the body more vivacious, chearfull, and lively to goe about a mans calling, trade, art or profeſſion, in the week following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Sports and paſtimes on one day have no ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and force to hold up the spirits</hi> for an after dayes worke.</p>
                     <p>It is the nights reſt, and not the ſporting on the Lords day, that doth it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>They are not ſeaſonable recreations on this day, to quicken the ſpirits by them:</hi> For ſeaſonable recreations is in labouring time, and is to be intermixt betweene labour, and labour, for to refreſh the wearineſſe of the ſpirits, to returne ſpeedily againe to labour. Recreation is, or ſhould be, as a baite to a Traveller, a bit, and away, as a whetting to a Mowers ſithe to cut afreſh, or as an houres ſleepe in the day time, ſhort and ſweet, to a wearied man, that muſt hold to his work: But the Lords day is not the time of Labour, but of reſt: There is a reſt a night before, there is a reſt on the day, and the nights reſt following: What needs then recreation in the time of ſo much reſt, when recreation hath ever relation to labour, and not to eaſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>There is no cauſe of the dulling and blunting of the ſpirits on this day,</hi> that there ſhould need ſports, and paſtimes for recreation: For if <hi>the ſpirits be wearyed</hi> this day, it is one of theſe waies following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Either</hi> with bodily labour about worldly buſineſſe, which ought not to be done, which rather men ſhould with tears bewaile, than leaving labour to runne to ſports for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Or with</hi> the reſt of the body in doing nothing, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding idlely, ſit chatting, or lying aſleep like beaſts, and ſo become drowzie, or lazie.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe moſt perſons ignorant of the heavenly uſe of an holy reſt, know not how to beſtow the time, but either about the world, or about pleaſures, when they are out of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102301:116"/> Church. But the well inſtructed know how to ſpend it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if ſlouthfull drowſineſſe ſhould take hold on them, they know how to ſtirre their bodies by walking, and in walking to meditate on Chriſt and his benefits alone, or to have ſome to conferre with, or to goe elſe alone to prayer, or having a family to inſtruct them, and ſo ſhake of their ſlouth, and not by gaming, ſporting, and playing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Or elſe the ſpirits are dull by going to the Church, and there continuing for the time:</hi> If this be alledged;</p>
                     <p n="1">1 I aske, how long are ſuch perſons in the whole dayes ſpace at the Church? In ſome Pariſhes (and too many of them) one houre in the forenoone, and leſſe in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, or an houre and halfe in the forenoone, and as much in the afternoone, and grant to the utmoſt in the whole day, three houres and a halfe, or foure houres, and that alſo at divided times, with a long pauſe betweene, perhaps of three or foure houres. Can foure houres in and about Chriſts Service and Worſhip, in twenty foure, dull and weaken the ſpirits of any, which carry the name of Chriſtians, and have any life of ſaving grace in them?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 I aske againe of theſe lovers of pleaſures, firſt, whether they come ſoone to Church, and are at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo abide to the end? Secondly, while they ſtay there, doe they not ſleep? or doe they not ſit idlely gazing about? or are they not carryed away with many by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts? If ſo, as too true, can they then plead the dulling of their ſpirits by ſo ſtaying ſinfully in the Congregation, drawing neare with their bodies, but in ſoule and heart be farre from God?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 I aske them, are they indeed devout Worſhippers, and attentive hearers? and doe they ſo underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they know what they have beene doing, what they have reaped thereby? then ſurely they cannot depart away dull in ſpirit, but bee glad of that they have heard, <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48. Neh. 8. 12.</note> glorifying the word of the Lord, and ſo depart away with joy, becauſe they have underſtood the words declared to them. Neither is it poſſible, that they ſhould be ſo poſſeſſed with ſuch prophane dotage and folly, that they ſhould
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102301:116"/> think (if they found any dulneſſe in hearing) that ſporting and playing, gaming, and paſtime, to be the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch ſpirituall dulneſſe, and to recover their ſpirits to a more chearfull and quicker attendance to Gods word, with joyfulneſſe of minde and heart in the uſe of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? So to think is both without religion, and alſo void of very reaſon it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore from hence, and from the ſubſtance of all that hath beene ſaid, I conclude, that on this day, ſports, games, and paſtimes, are needleſſe, and to be forborne.</p>
                     <p>And here I end, praying thus for my ſelfe and others.</p>
